	abstract = {Quantification of fear conditioning is paramount to many clinical and translational studies on aversive learning. Various measures of fear conditioning co-exist, including different observables and different methods of pre-processing. Here, we first argue that low measurement error is a rational desideratum for any measurement technique. We then show that measurement error can be approximated in benchmark experiments by how closely intended fear memory relates to measured fear memory, a quantity that we term retrodictive validity. From this perspective, we discuss different approaches commonly used to quantify fear conditioning. One of these is psychophysiological modelling (PsPM). This builds on a measurement model that describes how a psychological variable, such as fear memory, influences a physiological measure. This model is statistically inverted to estimate the most likely value of the psychological variable, given the measured data. We review existing PsPMs for skin conductance, pupil size, heart period, respiration, and startle eye-blink. We illustrate the benefit of PsPMs in terms of retrodictive validity and translate this into sample size required to achieve a desired level of statistical power. This sample size can differ up to a factor of three between different observables, and between the best, and the current standard, data pre-processing methods.},

	abstract = {Behavioural researchers often seek to experimentally manipulate, measure and analyse latent psychological attributes, such as memory, confidence or attention. The best measurement strategy is often difficult to intuit. Classical psychometric theory, mostly focused on individual differences in stable attributes, offers little guidance. Hence, measurement methods in experimental research are often based on tradition and differ between communities. Here we propose a criterion, which we term `retrodictive validity', that provides a relative numerical estimate of the accuracy of any given measurement approach. It is determined by performing calibration experiments to manipulate a latent attribute and assessing the correlation between intended and measured attribute values. Our approach facilitates optimising measurement strategies and quantifying uncertainty in the measurement. Thus, it allows power analyses to define minimally required sample sizes. Taken together, our approach provides a metrological perspective on measurement practice in experimental research that complements classical psychometrics.},

@article{Bach:2024aa,
	abstract = {Psychometrics is historically grounded in the study of individual differences. Consequently, common metrics such as quantitative validity and reliability require between-person variance in a psychological variable to be meaningful. Experimental psychology, in contrast, deals with variance between treatments, and experiments often strive to minimise within-group person variance. In this article, I ask whether and how psychometric evaluation can be performed in experimental psychology. A commonly used strategy is to harness between-person variance in the treatment effect. Using simulated data, I show that this approach can be misleading when between-person variance is low, and in the face of methods variance. I argue that this situation is common in experimental psychology, because low between-person variance is desirable, and because methods variance is no more problematic in experimental settings than any other source of between-person variance. By relating validity and reliability with the corresponding concepts in measurement science outside psychology, I show how experiment-based calibration can serve to compare the psychometric quality of different measurement methods in experimental psychology.},

@article{xia:2020,
	abstract = {Threat-conditioned cues are thought to capture overt attention in a bottom-up process. Quantification of this phenomenon typically relies on cue competition paradigms. Here, we sought to exploit gaze patterns during exclusive presentation of a visual conditioned stimulus, in order to quantify human threat conditioning. To this end, we capitalized on a summary statistic of visual search during CS presentation, scanpath length. During a simple delayed threat conditioning paradigm with full-screen monochrome conditioned stimuli (CS), we observed shorter scanpath length during CS+ compared to CS- presentation. Retrodictive validity, i.e., effect size to distinguish CS+ and CS-, was maximized by considering a 2-s time window before US onset. Taking into account the shape of the scan speed response resulted in similar retrodictive validity. The mechanism underlying shorter scanpath length appeared to be longer fixation duration and more fixation on the screen center during CS+ relative to CS- presentation. These findings were replicated in a second experiment with similar setup, and further confirmed in a third experiment using full-screen patterns as CS. This experiment included an extinction session during which scanpath differences appeared to extinguish. In a fourth experiment with auditory CS and instruction to fixate screen center, no scanpath length differences were observed. In conclusion, our study suggests scanpath length as a visual search summary statistic, which may be used as complementary measure to quantify threat conditioning with retrodictive validity similar to that of skin conductance responses.},

@article{Bach:2016aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive processes influence respiratory physiology. This may allow inferring cognitive states from measured respiration. Here, we take a first step towards this goal and investigate whether event-related respiratory responses can be identified, and whether they are accessible to a model-based approach.
NEW METHOD: We regard respiratory responses as the output of a linear time invariant system that receives brief inputs after psychological events. We derive average responses to visual targets, aversive stimulation, and viewing of arousing pictures, in interpolated respiration period (RP), respiration amplitude (RA), and respiratory flow rate (RFR). We then base a Psychophysiological Model (PsPM) on these averaged event-related responses. The PsPM is inverted to yield estimates of cognitive input into the respiratory system. This method is validated in an independent data set.
RESULTS: All three measures show event-related responses, which are captured as non-zero response amplitudes in the PsPM. Amplitude estimates for RA and RFR distinguish between picture viewing and the other tasks. This pattern is replicated in the validation experiment.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Existing respiratory measures are based on relatively short time-intervals after an event while the new method is based on the entire duration of respiratory responses.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that interpolated respiratory measures show replicable event-related response patterns. PsPM inversion is a suitable approach to analysing these patterns, with a potential to infer cognitive processes from respiration.},

	abstract = {This article describes the use of Bayes factors for comparing dynamic causal models (DCMs). DCMs are used to make inferences about effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These inferences, however, are contingent upon assumptions about model structure, that is, the connectivity pattern between the regions included in the model. Given the current lack of detailed knowledge on anatomical connectivity in the human brain, there are often considerable degrees of freedom when defining the connectional structure of DCMs. In addition, many plausible scientific hypotheses may exist about which connections are changed by experimental manipulation, and a formal procedure for directly comparing these competing hypotheses is highly desirable. In this article, we show how Bayes factors can be used to guide choices about model structure, both concerning the intrinsic connectivity pattern and the contextual modulation of individual connections. The combined use of Bayes factors and DCM thus allows one to evaluate competing scientific theories about the architecture of large-scale neural networks and the neuronal interactions that mediate perception and cognition.},

Using two independent fear conditioning datasets, we benchmark predictive validity as the sensitivity to separate the likely presence or absence of the unconditioned stimulus. Predictive validity is optimised across both datasets by (a) using a canonical form of the SCR shape (b) filtering the signal with a bi-directional band-pass filter with cut off frequencies 0.0159 and 5Hz, (c) simultaneously inverting two trials (d) explicitly modelling skin conductance level changes between trials (e) the choice of the inversion algorithm (f) z-scoring estimates of anticipatory sympathetic arousal from each participant across trials.

	abstract = {Tonic sympathetic arousal is often inferred from spontaneous fluctuations in skin conductance, and this relies on assumptions about the shape of these fluctuations and how they are generated. We have previously furnished a psychophysiological model for this relation, and an efficient and reliable inversion method to estimate tonic arousal from given data in the framework of dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Here, we provide a fast alternative inversion method in the form of a matching pursuit (MP) algorithm. Analyzing simulated data, this algorithm approximates the true underlying arousal up to about 10 spontaneous fluctuations per minute of data. For empirical data, we assess predictive validity as the ability to differentiate two known psychological arousal states. Predictive validity is comparable between the methods for three datasets, and also comparable to visual peak scoring. Computation time of the MP algorithm is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster for the MP than the DCM algorithm. In summary, the new MP algorithm provides a fast and reliable alternative to DCM inversion for SF data, in particular when the expected number of fluctuations is lower than 10 per minute, as in typical experimental situations.},

Here, I compare two model-based methods for analysis of evoked (stimulus-locked) SCR, implemented in two software packages, SCRalyze and Ledalab, with respect to their sensitivity in recovering SA. Four datasets are analysed to compare predictive validity, i.e. the sensitivity to distinguish pairs of SA states that are known to be different. SCRalyze was significantly better able than Ledalab to recover this known difference in four out of five tested contrasts and comparable in the remaining one. SCRalyze performed significantly better than conventional analysis in all contrasts. I conclude that the model-based method engendered in SCRalyze is currently the best available approach to provide robust and sensitive estimates of sympathetic arousal.},

	abstract = {Tonic sympathetic arousal is often inferred from spontaneous fluctuations in skin conductance, and this relies on assumptions about the shape of these fluctuations and how they are generated. We have previously furnished a psychophysiological model for this relation, and an efficient and reliable inversion method to estimate tonic arousal from given data in the framework of dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Here, we provide a fast alternative inversion method in the form of a matching pursuit (MP) algorithm. Analyzing simulated data, this algorithm approximates the true underlying arousal up to about 10 spontaneous fluctuations per minute of data. For empirical data, we assess predictive validity as the ability to differentiate two known psychological arousal states. Predictive validity is comparable between the methods for three datasets, and also comparable to visual peak scoring. Computation time of the MP algorithm is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster for the MP than the DCM algorithm. In summary, the new MP algorithm provides a fast and reliable alternative to DCM inversion for SF data, in particular when the expected number of fluctuations is lower than 10 per minute, as in typical experimental situations.},

	abstract = {This work is in line with an on-going effort tending toward a computational (quantitative and refutable) understanding of human neuro-cognitive processes. Many sophisticated models for behavioural and neurobiological data have flourished during the past decade. Most of these models are partly unspecified (i.e. they have unknown parameters) and nonlinear. This makes them difficult to peer with a formal statistical data analysis framework. In turn, this compromises the reproducibility of model-based empirical studies. This work exposes a software toolbox that provides generic, efficient and robust probabilistic solutions to the three problems of model-based analysis of empirical data: (i) data simulation, (ii) parameter estimation/model selection, and (iii) experimental design optimization.},

The method relies on the assumptions that the underlying sudomotor nerve signal has a shorter time-constant than the skin conductance signal itself, and that the sudomotor bursts arrive as discrete, separated events. By converting the skin conductance signal into a time-series with a shorter time-constant, we are able to extract the separated peaks in the estimated underlying driver signal. The separated driver peaks are then used to re-estimate each individual skin conductance response. The method is automated and applied to a normative database of 735 subjects, for which skin conductance was measured during an auditory oddball paradigm.},

	abstract = {Overlapping phasic skin conductance responses (SCRs) obtained using short interstimulus interval (ISI) paradigms such as those employed in cognitive research, confound measurement of each discrete phasic SCR as well as the tonic skin conductance level (SCL). We report a method of resolving this problem using a modelling technique that takes advantage of the stereotyped nature of the within-subject SCR waveform. A four-parameter sigmoid-exponential SCR model that describes the entire response, was developed and extended to five-, six- and eight-parameter skin conductance (SC) models. These SC models were successfully curve-fitted to more than 60 SC segments, each containing one SCR or two overlapping SCRs on a sloping baseline obtained from 20 normal subjects. The SC segments were consequently decomposed into their components: the tail of the previous response, one or two SCRs and the SCL. The SCRs free of the complication of overlap were then quantified. The raw SCRs of the same data set were also measured using a standard method. The standard measurement showed a significant reduction of 15% in amplitude and 140 ms in peak latency compared to our method. The basic four SCR model parameters--onset time, rise time, decay time constant and gain--showed increasing inter-subject variability in that order. These SCR model parameters may be studied as variables in normal and patient groups and as indices of treatment response. This quantitative method also provides a means to assess the relationships between central and autonomic psychophysiologic measures.},

The variability of SCR shapes hereby complicates the proper decomposition of SC data. A method is proposed for full decomposition of SC data into tonic and phasic components. A two-compartment diffusion model was found to adequately describe a standard SCR shape based on the process of sweat diffusion. Nonnegative deconvolution is used to decompose SC data into discrete compact responses and at the same time assess deviations from the standard SCR shape, which could be ascribed to the additional process of pore opening. Based on the result of single non-overlapped SCRs, response parameters can be estimated precisely as shown in a paradigm with varying inter-stimulus intervals.},

	abstract = {Electrodermal activity is characterized by the superposition of what appear to be single distinct skin conductance responses (SCRs). Classic trough-to-peak analysis of these responses is impeded by their apparent superposition. A deconvolution approach is proposed, which separates SC data into continuous signals of tonic and phasic activity. The resulting phasic activity shows a zero baseline, and overlapping SCRs are represented by predominantly distinct, compact impulses showing an average duration of less than 2 s. A time integration of the continuous measure of phasic activity is proposed as a straightforward indicator of event-related sympathetic activity. The quality and benefit of the proposed measure is demonstrated in an experiment with short interstimulus intervals as well as by means of a simulation study. The advances compared to previous decomposition methods are discussed.},

This scheme extends established approximate inference on hidden-states to cover: (i) nonlinear evolution and observation functions, (ii) unknown parameters and (precision) hyperparameters and (iii) model comparison and prediction under uncertainty. Model identification or inversion entails the estimation of the marginal likelihood or evidence of a model. This difficult integration problem can be finessed by optimising a free-energy bound on the evidence using results from variational calculus. This yields a deterministic update scheme that optimises an approximation to the posterior density on the unknown model variables. We derive such a variational Bayesian scheme in the context of nonlinear stochastic dynamic hierarchical models, for both model identification and time-series prediction. The computational complexity of the scheme is comparable to that of an extended Kalman filter, which is critical when inverting high dimensional models or long time-series. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we assess the estimation efficiency of this variational Bayesian approach using three stochastic variants of chaotic dynamic systems. We also demonstrate the model comparison capabilities of the method, its self-consistency and its predictive power.},

@article{Friston:2000aa,
	abstract = {There is a growing appreciation of the importance of nonlinearities in evoked responses in fMRI, particularly with the advent of event-related fMRI. These nonlinearities are commonly expressed as interactions among stimuli that can lead to the suppression and increased latency of responses to a stimulus that are incurred by a preceding stimulus. We have presented previously a model-free characterization of these effects using generic techniques from nonlinear system identification, namely a Volterra series formulation. At the same time Buxton et al. (1998) described a plausible and compelling dynamical model of hemodynamic signal transduction in fMRI. Subsequent work by Mandeville et al. (1999) provided important theoretical and empirical constraints on the form of the dynamic relationship between blood flow and volume that underpins the evolution of the fMRI signal. In this paper we combine these system identification and model-based approaches and ask whether the Balloon model is sufficient to account for the nonlinear behaviors observed in real time series. We conclude that it can, and furthermore the model parameters that ensue are biologically plausible. This conclusion is based on the observation that the Balloon model can produce Volterra kernels that emulate empirical kernels. To enable this evaluation we had to embed the Balloon model in a hemodynamic input-state-output model that included the dynamics of perfusion changes that are contingent on underlying synaptic activation. This paper presents (i) the full hemodynamic model (ii), how its associated Volterra kernels can be derived, and (iii) addresses the model's validity in relation to empirical nonlinear characterizations of evoked responses in fMRI and other neurophysiological constraints.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an approach to characterizing evoked hemodynamic responses in fMRI based on nonlinear system identification, in particular the use of Volterra series. The approach employed enables one to estimate Volterra kernels that describe the relationship between stimulus presentation and the hemodynamic responses that ensue. Volterra series are essentially high-order extensions of linear convolution or "smoothing." These kernels, therefore, represent a nonlinear characterization of the hemodynamic response function that can model the responses to stimuli in different contexts (in this work, different rates of word presentation) and interactions among stimuli. The nonlinear components of the responses were shown to be statistically significant, and the kernel estimates were validated using an independent event-related fMRI experiment. One important manifestation of these nonlinear effects is a modulation of stimulus-specific responses by preceding stimuli that are proximate in time. This means that responses at high-stimulus presentation rates saturate and, in some instances, show an inverted U behavior. This behavior appears to be specific to BOLD effects (as distinct from evoked changes in cerebral blood flow) and may represent a hemodynamic "refractoriness." The aim of this paper is to describe the theory and techniques upon which these conclusions were based and to discuss the implications for experimental design and analysis.},

In order to examine the relationship between the skin resistance level and the amplitude of transient resistance responses, trains of high frequency stimulation were used to reduce the skin resistance level and then transient resistance responses were evoked by single stimuli at 0.1 Hz. Regional anaesthesia of the brachial plexus in the axilla eliminated spontaneous sympathetic activity and reflex effects. At high skin resistance levels response amplitudes to single stimuli were low but they increased successively to a maximum at intermediate levels and then decreased again at low resistance levels. Repeated stimulation sequences evoked qualitatively similar response curves but quantitatively both response amplitudes and skin resistance levels were slightly reduced upon repetition. We suggest that the changes of response amplitudes are due to variable resistivity of the corneal layer. The shifts of the response curves with repetition of stimulation may result from increased hydration of the corneum. It is concluded that the variability of response amplitudes to constant stimuli makes the amplitude of a skin resistance response unsuitable as an indicator of the strength of sympathetic sudomotor nerve traffic.},

The aims were: (1) to investigate the response variability between repeated stimulation sequences in the same skin site and between different sites and (2) to compare quantitative effects of regular and irregular stimulation on skin resistance and wvpp. Regional axillary anaesthesia of the brachial plexus eliminated spontaneous and reflex sympathetic activity. With repeated irregular stimulation sequences skin resistance responses from the same skin site varied only slightly between trials. Differences between response curves from two skin sites in the same subject or from different subjects were also small but significantly greater (P < 0.01) than differences between responses to repeated stimulation in the same site. Irregular stimulation with average frequencies of 0.49 Hz and 3.51 Hz gave greater resistance responses than if the same number of stimuli were delivered regularly (P < 0.01). The difference was most pronounced at 0.49 Hz. At an average frequency of 0.49 Hz the stimulation usually evoked no changes of wvpp whereas an average frequency of 3.51 Hz caused an increase of wvpp which was greater with irregular than with regular stimulation in all subjects. We conclude that: (1) sweat responses to sudomotor nerve traffic vary slightly due to local factors in the skin or the terminal nerve endings and (2) irregular sudomotor nerve traffic evokes more sweat than if the same impulses occur regularly.},

Intraneural electrical stimuli (0.3-1.2 mA, 0.2 ms) were delivered via a tungsten microelectrode inserted into a cutaneous fascicle in the median nerve at the wrist in twenty-eight normal subjects. The effects on sweat glands within the innervation zone were monitored as changes of skin resistance and water vapour partial pressure (WVPP). Regional anaesthesia of the brachial plexus in the axilla eliminated spontaneous sympathetic activity and reflex effects. 2. At stimulation frequencies of 0.1 Hz each stimulus evoked a transient skin resistance reduction, the amplitude of which varied initially but reached a steady state of less than 10 k omega after, on average, nine responses. If preceded by stimulation-free intervals of 5 min or more, up to fifteen stimuli were required before the first response occurred. With higher frequencies individual responses started to merge, skin resistance levels decreased successively and levelled off around 10 Hz. The total change of resistance (0-10 Hz) was 101 +/- 46 (n = 9) k omega and the higher the pre-stimulus level, the larger the reduction (r = 0.68, P less than 0.05). 3. Stimulus-response latencies to the onset of a skin resistance reduction (single stimuli or trains of six impulses/20 Hz given at 0.1 Hz) shortened initially but reached steady-state values after on average nine to twelve impulses. Average conduction velocity between stimulating electrode and skin resistance recording site was 0.78 m/s and average time for electrical neuroeffector transfer in sweat glands was estimated to be 348 ms. 4. In addition to direct stimulation-induced resistance responses there were also small spontaneous reductions of resistance. They were seen in all subjects and at all frequencies but were more common in some subjects and occurred predominantly at the beginning of stimulation or at changes of frequency. They occurred independently at two skin sites in the same subject and disappeared during stimulation-free periods and after atropine. 5. With train stimulation (six impulses/20 Hz) at 0.1 Hz, each train evoked transient increases of WVPP of 1 mmHg or less in some subjects (latency around 1.6 s). After averaging weak increases were seen also after single stimuli in two subjects. Increases of stimulation current or frequency led to slowly developing sustained increases of WVPP concomitant with decreases in skin resistance. 6. Responses in skin resistance and WVPP to train stimulation at 0.1 Hz were suppressed in a dose-dependent way by I.V. injections of atropine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Sweat expulsion was identified on the sweat rate records obtained from skin areas on the dorsal side of the foot, for spontaneous sweating and drug-induced sweating, using capacitance hygrometry. Sweat expulsion was always preceded by bursts of SSA with latencies of 2.4-3.0 s. This temporal relationship between bursts of SSA and sweat expulsion was noted not only in various degrees of thermal sweating but also in the sweating evoked by arousal stimuli, or by painful electric stimulation. The amplitude of the sudomotor burst was linearly related to the maximal rate of increase of the corresponding sweat expulsion, the amplitude of the expulsion and the integrated amount of sweat produced for the duration of the expulsion. The results provide direct evidence that sweat expulsion reflects directly centrally-derived sudomotor activity.},

	abstract = {1. Recordings of multiunit sympathetic activity were made from human nerve fascicles supplying hairy and glabrous skin of the extremities in healthy subjects exposed to different ambient temperatures. Sudomotor and vasomotor events accompanying the neural activity were monitored by simultaneous recordings of electrodermal and pulse plethysmographic events (Pleth) in the neural innervation zones. 2. By exposing the subject to warm (43 degrees C) or cold (15 degrees C) environments, it was possible to obtain a selective activation of either the sudomotor or the vasoconstrictor neural system, respectively, with suppression of spontaneous activity in the other system. 3. Bursts of both vasoconstrictor and sudomotor nerve activity were found to occur at certain preferred intervals which were integer multiples of a period of about 0 . 6 sec (100 cycles/min). With high sudomotor or vasoconstrictor tone the 100 cycles/min rhythm was prominent but with decreasing tone slower subharmonic rhythms prevailed. Respiratory rhythms were also discerned as well as slower rhythms attributable to oscillatory tendencies in thermoregulatory servos. 4. Vasoconstrictor bursts had longer mean duration than sudomotor bursts, a finding attributed to a slower conduction velocity of vasoconstrictor as compared to sudomotor impulses. 5. With increasing incidence of bursts transient electrodermal or plethysmographic responses following individual bursts merged, and thus the fast neural rhythms were not discernible in either the electrodermal or Pleth traces. Given increments in firing rate of nerves produced less additional vasoconstriction at high than at low firing rates. The rhythm generating mechanisms may help to restrict rates of individual fibres to the low range which provides high gain in the neuroeffector transfer functions.},

Many experimental manipulations in cognitive neuroscience dictate paradigms with short inter trial intervals, precluding accurate baseline estimation for SCR measurements. Here, we present a novel and general approach to SCR analysis, derived from methods used in neuroimaging that estimate responses using a linear convolution model. In effect, the method obviates peak-scoring and makes use of the full SCR. We demonstrate, across three experiments, that the method has face validity in analysing reactions to a loud white noise and emotional pictures, can be generalised to paradigms where the shape of the response function is unknown and can account for parametric trial-by-trial effects. We suggest our approach provides greater flexibility in analysing SCRs than existing methods.},

In developing a mathematical framework for analysis of skin conductance responses [SCRs], we formalise our assumptions by positing that SCRs can be regarded as the output of a linear time-invariant filter. Here, we provide an empirical test of these assumptions. Our findings indicate that a large component of the variance in SCRs can be explained by one response function per individual. We note that baseline variance (i.e. variance in the absence of evoked responses) is higher than variance that could not be explained by a linear time-invariant model of evoked responses. Furthermore, there was no evidence for nonlinear interactions among evoked responses that depended on their temporal overlap. We develop a canonical response function and show that it can be used for signals from different recording sites. We discuss the implications of these observations for model-based analysis of SCRs.},

Here, we describe a dynamic causal model [DCM] of how anticipatory, evoked, and spontaneous skin conductance changes are generated by sudomotor nerve activity. Inversion of this model, using variational Bayes, provides a means of inferring the most likely sympathetic nerve activity, given observed skin conductance responses. In two fear conditioning experiments, we demonstrate the predictive validity of the DCM by showing it has greater sensitivity to the effects of conditioning, relative to alternative (conventional) response estimates. Furthermore, we establish face validity by showing that trial-by-trial estimates of anticipatory sudomotor activity are better predicted by formal learning models, relative to response estimates from peak-scoring approaches. The model furnishes a potentially powerful approach to characterising SCR that exploits knowledge about how these signals are generated.},

We have previously established the improved predictive validity of model-based analysis of evoked skin conductance responses to brief stimuli, relative to standard approaches. Here, we consider some technical aspects of the underlying generative model and demonstrate further improvements. Most importantly, harvesting between-subject variability in response shape can improve predictive validity, but only under constraints on plausible response forms. A further improvement is achieved by conditioning the physiological signal with high pass filtering. A general conclusion is that precise modelling of physiological time series does not markedly increase predictive validity; instead, it appears that a more constrained model and optimised data features provide better results, probably through a suppression of physiological fluctuation that is not caused by the experiment.},

	abstract = {Pupil size is often used to infer central processes, including attention, memory, and emotion. Recent research has spotlighted its relation to behavioral variables from decision-making models and to neural variables such as locus coeruleus activity and cortical oscillations. As yet, a unified and principled approach for analyzing pupil responses is lacking. Here we seek to establish a formal, quantitative forward model for pupil responses by describing them with linear time-invariant systems. Based on empirical data from human participants, we show that a combination of two linear time-invariant systems can parsimoniously explain approximately all variance evoked by illuminance changes. Notably, the model makes a counterintuitive prediction that pupil constriction dominates the responses to darkness flashes, as in previous empirical reports. This prediction was quantitatively confirmed for responses to light and darkness flashes in an independent group of participants. Crucially, illuminance- and nonilluminance-related inputs to the pupillary system are presumed to share a common final pathway, composed of muscles and nerve terminals. Hence, we can harness our illuminance-based model to estimate the temporal evolution of this neural input for an auditory-oddball task, an emotional-words task, and a visual-detection task. Onset and peak latencies of the estimated neural inputs furnish plausible hypotheses for the complexity of the underlying neural circuit. To conclude, this mathematical description of pupil responses serves as a prerequisite to refining their relation to behavioral and brain indices of cognitive processes.},

	abstract = {Pupil size is correlated with a wide variety of important cognitive variables and is increasingly being used by cognitive scientists. Pupil data can be recorded inexpensively and non-invasively by many commonly used video-based eye-tracking cameras. Despite the relative ease of data collection and increasing prevalence of pupil data in the cognitive literature, researchers often underestimate the methodological challenges associated with controlling for confounds that can result in misinterpretation of their data. One serious confound that is often not properly controlled is pupil foreshortening error (PFE)---the foreshortening of the pupil image as the eye rotates away from the camera. Here we systematically map PFE using an artificial eye model and then apply a geometric model correction. Three artificial eyes with different fixed pupil sizes were used to systematically measure changes in pupil size as a function of gaze position with a desktop EyeLink 1000 tracker. A grid-based map of pupil measurements was recorded with each artificial eye across three experimental layouts of the eye-tracking camera and display. Large, systematic deviations in pupil size were observed across all nine maps. The measured PFE was corrected by a geometric model that expressed the foreshortening of the pupil area as a function of the cosine of the angle between the eye-to-camera axis and the eye-to-stimulus axis. The model reduced the root mean squared error of pupil measurements by 82.5 \% when the model parameters were pre-set to the physical layout dimensions, and by 97.5 \% when they were optimized to fit the empirical error surface.},

	abstract = {Respiratory physiology is influenced by cognitive processes. It has been suggested that some cognitive states may be inferred from respiration amplitude responses (RAR) after external events. Here, we investigate whether RAR allow assessment of fear memory in cued fear conditioning, an experimental model of aversive learning. To this end, we built on a previously developed psychophysiological model (PsPM) of RAR, which regards interpolated RAR time series as the output of a linear time invariant system. We first establish that average RAR after CS+ and CS- are different. We then develop the response function of fear-conditioned RAR, to be used in our PsPM. This PsPM is inverted to yield estimates of cognitive input into the respiratory system. We analyze five validation experiments involving fear acquisition and retention, delay and trace conditioning, short and medium CS-US intervals, and data acquired with bellows and MRI-compatible pressure chest belts. In all experiments, CS+ and CS- are distinguished by their estimated cognitive inputs, and the sensitivity of this distinction is higher for model-based estimates than for peak scoring of RAR. Comparing these data with skin conductance responses (SCR) and heart period responses (HPR), we find that, on average, RAR performs similar to SCR in distinguishing CS+ and CS-, but is less sensitive than HPR. Overall, our work provides a novel and robust tool to investigate fear memory in humans that may allow wide and straightforward application to diverse experimental contexts.},

@article{Kirno:1991aa,
	abstract = {To study the relationship between skin sympathetic nerve activity and changes in skin resistance (galvanic skin response--GSR), efferent sympathetic and sensory nerves to the hand were blocked by an axillary nerve blockade in 15 healthy subjects. Subsequently, intraneural electrical stimuli in the median nerve distal to the axillary nerve block were used to evoke changes in skin resistance and in water vapor partial pressure in the sensory and sympathetically denervated hand. With increasing frequency of stimulation, skin resistance decreased and water vapor partial pressure increased until stimuli exceeded 10 Hz. When an additional burst of impulses was added to the background stimulation, GSR amplitude varied in a nonlinear fashion with the background frequency. Stimulation-induced GSR was completely abolished in a dose-dependent manner by systemically (intravenously) administered atropine. The results indicate that GSR depends on the preceding level of nerve traffic in the sympathetic sudomotor nerve fibers. Consequently, skin resistance recordings cannot be used to quantify sympathetic nerve traffic and thus do not express the completeness of sympathetic blockade in regional anesthesia.},

	abstract = {During fear conditioning, pupil size responses dissociate between conditioned stimuli that are contingently paired (CS+) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus, and those that are unpaired (CS-). Current approaches to assess fear learning from pupil responses rely on ad hoc specifications. Here, we sought to develop a psychophysiological model (PsPM) in which pupil responses are characterized by response functions within the framework of a linear time-invariant system. This PsPM can be written as a general linear model, which is inverted to yield amplitude estimates of the eliciting process in the central nervous system. We first characterized fear-conditioned pupil size responses based on an experiment with auditory CS. PsPM-based parameter estimates distinguished CS+/CS- better than, or on par with, two commonly used methods (peak scoring, area under the curve). We validated this PsPM in four independent experiments with auditory, visual, and somatosensory CS, as well as short (3.5 s) and medium (6 s) CS/US intervals. Overall, the new PsPM provided equal or decisively better differentiation of CS+/CS- than the two alternative methods and was never decisively worse. We further compared pupil responses with concurrently measured skin conductance and heart period responses. Finally, we used our previously developed luminance-related pupil responses to infer the timing of the likely neural input into the pupillary system. Overall, we establish a new PsPM to assess fear conditioning based on pupil responses. The model has a potential to provide higher statistical sensitivity, can be applied to other conditioning paradigms in humans, and may be easily extended to nonhuman mammals.},

@article{Bach:2017aa,
	abstract = {Learning to predict threat is a fundamental ability of many biological organisms, and a laboratory model for anxiety disorders. Interfering with such memories in humans would be of high clinical relevance. On the basis of studies in cell cultures and slice preparations, it is hypothesised that synaptic remodelling required for threat learning involves the extracellular enzyme matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9. However, in vivo evidence for this proposal is lacking. Here we investigate human Pavlovian fear conditioning under the blood--brain barrier crossing MMP inhibitor doxycyline in a pre-registered, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We find that recall of threat memory, measured with fear-potentiated startle 7 days after acquisition, is attenuated by {\textasciitilde}60\% in individuals who were under doxycycline during acquisition. This threat memory impairment is also reflected in increased behavioural surprise signals to the conditioned stimulus during subsequent re-learning, and already late during initial acquisition. Our findings support an emerging view that extracellular signalling pathways are crucially required for threat memory formation. Furthermore, they suggest novel pharmacological methods for primary prevention and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder.},

@article{Gerster:2017aa,
	abstract = {Skin conductance responses (SCR) are increasingly analyzed with model-based approaches that assume a linear and time-invariant (LTI) mapping from sudomotor nerve (SN) activity to observed SCR. These LTI assumptions have previously been validated indirectly, by quantifying how much variance in SCR elicited by sensory stimulation is explained under an LTI model. This approach, however, collapses sources of variability in the nervous and effector organ systems. Here, we directly focus on the SN/SCR mapping by harnessing two invasive methods. In an intraneural recording experiment, we simultaneously track SN activity and SCR. This allows assessing the SN/SCR relationship but possibly suffers from interfering activity of non-SN sympathetic fibers. In an intraneural stimulation experiment under regional anesthesia, such influences are removed. In this stimulation experiment, about 95\% of SCR variance is explained under LTI assumptions when stimulation frequency is below 0.6 Hz. At higher frequencies, nonlinearities occur. In the intraneural recording experiment, explained SCR variance is lower, possibly indicating interference from non-SN fibers, but higher than in our previous indirect tests. We conclude that LTI systems may not only be a useful approximation but in fact a rather accurate description of biophysical reality in the SN/SCR system, under conditions of low baseline activity and sporadic external stimuli. Intraneural stimulation under regional anesthesia is the most sensitive method to address this question.},
