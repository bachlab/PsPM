Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What is psychophysiological modelling?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The psychophysiological inverse problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Psychophysiology is concerned with the relationship between the mind (i.e.
 psychological processes) and the body (including the nervous).
 This relationship is bidirectional: the mind influences the body, but processes
 in the body are monitored by the mind via proprioception and interoception.
 Knowledge on this bidirectional relationship affords for instance examining
 more closely how psychological factors influence health, or how the interceptiv
e abilities of an individual affect his psychological well-being.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, a very common application of psychophysiological knowledge is to
 measure processes in the body (sweating, heart activity, respiration, etc.)
 to assess processes in the mind.
 This is an inverse problem.
 The researcher is not actually interested whether skin conductance is different
 between two conditions (the forward relation).
 They are interested, for example, whether a subject successfully learned
 an association between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an electric shock,
 and use skin conductance to measure this learning process.
 To make this inverse inference, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turn the forward model around
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - they ask, what has happened in the mind, given what is measured in the
 body.
 There are several way of doing this, and all require good knowledge of
 the forward relationship.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Operational analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Operational approaches seek to identify data features (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

indices
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that closely follow a psychological state of interest.
 Operational data analysis algorithms extract these data features, to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 central states.
 For example, to infer stimulus-evoked sympathetic arousal (SA) from skin
 conductance responses (SCR), one may filter the SCR data to reduce observation
 noise, define a response window after the stimulus, and define some criteria
 do detect peaks within this window.
 The amplitude of such peaks may then be taken as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of SA.
 The development of such indices is an important application of psychophysiology.
 Such indices are usually based on qualitative or semi-quantitative models
 of how the index relates to the psychological state of interest.
 Model-based analysis has precisely the same goal as operational analysis
 - but seeks to make these implict models explicit (i.e.
 testable) in mathematical form - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for a review.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model-based analysis 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model-based approaches start with explicit, mathematical models that formulate
 how observed data are generated by psychological processes.
 For example, a model may formulate the relation between sympathetic arousal
 (SA) and skin conductance responses (SCR), 
\begin_inset Formula $SA\mapsto SCR$
\end_inset

, in mathematical form.
 This kind of model is often termed a "forward model": it predicts a data
 time series (SCR) from a known psychological process (SA).
 Another term for this kind of model is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because it describes how a psychological process generates the data.
 When we analyse experimental data, we are faced with the opposite situation:
 we know the observed data data but not the central process, and seek to
 infer the central process from the data.
 In order to do so, one has to turn the forward model backwards, to arrive
 at the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $SA\mapsfrom SCR$
\end_inset

.
 In statistics, this process is often termed "model inversion".
 It provides the most likely estimates of the central process, given the
 observed data and the model.
 Both conventional and model-based analysis aim to infer central process
 from observed data.
 The difference is that model-based methods use a stringent mathematical
 language and probabilistic model inversion to do so.
 Note that probabilistic models acknowledge the existence of noise in the
 data, and they do not seek to explain this noise with variation in psychologica
l states.
 Hence, the criterion for the quality of a model-based method is not how
 well the model 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fits the data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but how well it can recover the psychological variables of interest.
 In other words, the model should be able to fit the data but at the same
 time to ignore noise in the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Method comparison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How can we infer that one method of inferring a central state is better
 than another? Each method returns indices or estimates of the psychological
 state, but which ones are more precise? Psychological variables cannot
 be measured directly, so how can we compare our estimates to ground truth?
 The solution we propose is to experimentally create psychological states
 that are known.
 We can then evaluate how well a method recovers these known states.
 In the simple example of fear conditioning, we could compute a paired t-test
 on the CS+/CS- difference in the estimates and look at the t-value.
 the method that yields the highest t-value is most precise.
 But is it also significantly more precise than another method? This can
 be assessed with a formal model comparison.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our example, we can try to predict CS identity (CS+/CS-) from the model
 estimates.
 This means we quantify evidence for a model in which individual participants'
 CS+ and CS- estimates are drawn from two distributions with different means,
 rather than the same mean.
 In other words, we are using a regression model that seeks to predict the
 known psychological state (dependent variable) from the estimated psychological
 state (independent variable).
 Note that this is different from a more convential regression or ANOVA
 model in which the data are the dependent variable and experimental conditions
 are the independent variable.
 This difference is important.
 In our approach, when comparing different methods, the dependent variable
 (the true state) will be the same, and the independent variable (the state
 estimates) will differ.
 This means that the total sum of squares (TSS) in the model will be constant.
 Thus, we can use the residual sum of squares (RSS) to compute model evidence
 and compare models - i.e.
 compare evidence for the statement that the method's estimates of the psycholog
ical state predict the true psychological state.
 We have termed this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

predictive validity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Note that the model is not predictive in time - we are not trying to predict
 unknown data values.
 We are trying to predict true psychological state from the estimated state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To quantify model evidence, PsPM uses the following approximation to Akaike
 Information Criterion (AIC) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Burnham:2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
AIC=n\log\left(RSS/n\right)+2k=-2\log\left(L\right)+2k,
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of data points in the predictive model, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the maximum of the likelihood function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the number of parameters in the predictive model.
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is constant for all methods that are evaluated in a methods comparison.
 We only interpret AIC differences, so this complexity term disappears from
 methods comparison.
 AIC differences divided by 2 can be interpreted as log Bayes Factors (LBF).
 In our case this quantifies the relative evidence that one method's estimates
 predict the true psychological state, relative to the other method.
 An absolute LBF of greater than 3 is usually regarded as decisive.
 This is because for a classical significance threshold of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=.05$
\end_inset

, the probability of the data given the null hypothesis is 
\begin_inset Formula $p<.05$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, for an LBF difference larger than 3, the relative probability
 that the inferior method predicts the true psychological state given the
 data is 
\begin_inset Formula $p<\exp\left(-3\right)\approx0.05$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Penny:2004aa"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All methods included in PsPM have empirically been shown to provide better
 or equal predictive validity than the best available corresponding conventional
 index.
 Although in most validation experiments only two conditions need to be
 distinguished (a discrimination problem), the goal of PsPM is to provide
 minimum-variance estimates of cognitive processes also in situations in
 which the cognitive process varies across more than just two levels.
 This is why we do not use discrimination methods to evaluate the models.
 Also, since most psychophysiological measures are influenced by a variety
 of cognitive processes, inference on a specific process unavoidably rests
 on a suitable experimental design in which different conditions only differ
 on this dimension, and not on other dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, this approach to method comparison can also be used to improve
 operational indices, or event to create new indices in a blind classification
 approach based on large data sets.

Historical remark:
\shape default
 Some papers from the PsPM team have used the formula: 
\begin_inset Formula $NLL=n\log\left(RSS/n\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If NLL is read as an arbitrary variable name, this formula is consistent
 with the previous paragaphs.
 However, note that NLL in this formula is not the negative log likelihood
 (as confusingly implied in the papers), but really the AIC without complexity
 correction.
 The numerical value of the negative log likelihood would in this terminology
 be 
\begin_inset Formula $NLL/2$

\begin_layout Section
General model structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All model in PsPM split the relation between mind and body into two models,
 a peripheral and a neural model.
 The peripheral model describes how a neural impulse is converted to a measurabl
e signal.
 The neural model describes the relation between the psychological process
 and the neural input into the peripheral system.
 This distinction is historically based on SCR models.
 The neural signal that elicits SCR can be measured by intraneural recordings,
 and its properties are in principle known.
 Hence it appeared plausible for various research groups to create a peripheral
 model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Alexander:2005aa,Bach:2009aa,Benedek:2010ab"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that takes an arbitrary neural input, and several neural models were then
 combined with this peripheral model.
 This distinction has later been used for other modalities, too: first because
 it appeared simple from a practical standpoint, secondly because it is
 often plausible to assume that the peripheral process is not directly influence
d by psychological states, but only via a neural input.
 Note, however, that the peripheral/neural distinction in the model implementati
on is not always consistent with biophysical reality and tends to follow
 a need for manageable inversion algorithms.
 Indeed, some models collapse peripheral and stereotypical neural processes
 into the peripheral model.
 Examples are the GLMs for fear-conditioned HPR, PSR, and RAR - this is
 unlike the non-linear SCR model in which parameters of the neural model
 are estimated explicitly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Peripheral models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The peripheral models in PsPM collapse all physiological and biophysical
 processes involved in the generation of the measured signal.
 For most psychophysiological measures, these processes are not known at
 the level of detail required to build true biophysical models from theory.
 In fact, biophysical models for the best-investigated modality, SCR, tend
 to not fit the observed data very well 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Benedek:2010aa,Alexander:2005aa"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This is why PsPM uses purely phenomenological models which regard the periphera
l system as a black box.
 By applying controlled inputs into the system, and measuring the output,
 one can then approximate the workings of this black box in mathematical
 form, without knowing its content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
LTI systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crucially, all models in PsPM assume that the peripheral system can be described
 by one (or several) linear time invariant (LTI) systems with the defining
 properties linearity and time invariance.
 A LTI system is unambiguously described by its response function (RF).
 By linearity, input and output are linearly mapped so the responses to
 several inputs can be simply obtained by summing the responses to individual
 inputs.
 Time invariance means that the output does not explicitly depend on the
 time, i.e.
 that the shape of the RF is constant over time while the amplitude can
 vary.
 It is usually also assumed that the RF is constant over individuals, although
 this assumption is not necessary in the PsPM framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In principle, linearity ensures pure summation of two overlapping inputs.
 This is not realistic if the system has limited dynamic range and saturates
 due to a quick succession of inputs (e.
 g.
 the heart rate cannot increase indefinitely).
 One can formulate limits, for each data modality, within which the model
 is a useful approximation to reality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some modalities, the two properties linearity and time invariance can
 be explicitly tested by neural recordings (e.g.
 for SCR).
 For other modalities, this is not possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematically, the output 
\begin_inset Formula $y\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 of a LTI system can be fully described by convolving input 
\begin_inset Formula $u(t)$
\end_inset

 with the system’s response function 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)$
\end_inset

 and can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y(t)=u(t)*h(t)=∫_{0}^{∞}u(t-τ)h(τ)dτ.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset

In many cases, the peripheral system is not exactly LTI but can be approximated
 by the combination of several LTI systems.
 The common case is the inclusion of RF derivatives to account for between-subje
ct variability in RF shape and latency, and a special case the combination
 of a dilation and a constriction RF in pupil size modelling.
 In our terminology, the RF then has 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

components
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(t\right)=h_{1..k}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In such cases, the amplitude estimates for several response functions need
 to be combined.
 In PsPM, this is usually (unless indicated otherwise) done by multiplying
 each component of the RF with its amplitude estimate, and adding them.
 The peak of highest absolute amplitude is then identified, and its signed
 amplitude extracted as estimate of neural input amplitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Signal frequencies in the data that are not present in the RF do not contribute
 to the model inversion and can be filtered out.
 If the true RF were known, the matched filter theorem provides a way of
 theoretically deriving a filter that maximises the signal-to-noise ratio
 for the model inversion.
 In most cases, the true RF is not precisely known, and also varies between
 individuals.
 This is why PsPM seeks to empirically determine the filter characteristics
 that maximise predictive validity of psychological state estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Neural models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The neural model in PsPM describes the form of the neural input that the
 peripheral model can take, and thus, the relation between mind and neural
 system.
 In general, model inversion benefits from constraining the neural model,
 i.e.
 from reducing the number of parameters that have to be estimated.
 We have empirically shown for SCR models that in many cases, a strongly
 constrained neural model will result in higher predictive validity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bach:2013aa,Bach:2014aa,Staib:2015aa"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most PsPM models assume an instantaneous (delta) neural input into the periphera
l system at a known time point 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u\left(t\right)=\delta\left(t_{i}\right).
\]

\end_inset

Only the amplitude of the neural input is then estimated, and is taken as
 estimate of the psychological state.
 This renders the model suitable for GLM inversion (see below).
 Less constrained models require non-linear inversion methods and can also
 deal with variable onset, dispersion, or shape, of the neural input.

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hierarchical summary statistic approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is common in psychophysiology (and psychology in general) to compute
 summary statistics for each cell of the design, and for each subject.
 These estimates of are then entered into a group-level model.
 To implement this approach, PsPM estimates parameters for each participant
 separately, either per experimental condition, or per trial with subsequent
 averaging within the experimental condition.
 In line with fMRI terminology (and different from many branches of psychology),
 we use the terms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first-level
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

second-level
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the individual and group level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multi-level modelling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-level models, also termed linear mixed effects model (LME) or random-effec
t models, are becoming increasingly popular in psychology 
\color black

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pinheiro:2000aa"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The idea is to take variance between trials into account: a summary statistic
 that is computed from individual data points with high variance is less
 precise that a statistic from low-variance data, and such information is
 lost when summarising within each condition.
 PsPM offers the possibility to compute trial-by-trial estimates (by modelling
 each trial as a separate condition in GLM, or by default in DCM for SCR).
 This approach has been used for SCR, PSR and SEBR 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bach:2017aa"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For GLM, modelling trial-by-trial amplitudes and averaging within conditions
 yields the same result as modelling condition-by-condition amplitudes,
 if the design matrix is of full rank and there is only one basis function.
 With more than one basis function, the results will deviate for the second
 and further basis functions in the basis set, because the orthogonalisation
 with the basis set is not a linear operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory it would also be possible to account for variability within the
 time series, i.e.
 between data points, not only between trials.
 Such approaches are implemented for fMRI, but they are not trivial.
 First, model inversion is much slower by the inclusion of many subjects.
 Secondly, in the time-series data analysed in PsPM, errors are usually
 not independent.
 This is usually not a problem for parameter estimation but impacts on the
 effective degrees of freedom and thus renders statistical tests in these
 models invalid, and this would apply to multi-level models, too.
 fMRI softwares solve this problem by estimating an auto-regression model
 on the first level but this is usually done on data from many data channels/vox
els, and this is not possible for single-channel data in psychophysiology.
 This is why PsPM does not offer statistical tests on the time-series level.
 For the trial-wise or condition-wise summary statistic approach in PsPM,
 the dependencies between data points on the first level are unproblematic.

Probabilistic model inversion

All peripheral and neural models in PsPM are approximations to reality.
 It is hence assumed that there is measurement error (imprecision of the
 peripheral model)

\end_inset

 in the data, and that the neural input is not truthfully described by the
 neural model such that it contains latent error, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 While this distinction between 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is theoretically interesting and often physiologically plausible, the model
 inversion methods collapse these two sources of error:

 A GLM can be written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y=Xβ+\epsilon.
\]

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is the vector of observations (time series data), 
\begin_inset Formula $β$
\end_inset

 is a vector of input amplitude parameters and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is the error.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is design matrix in which each column is obtained by convolving impulse
 functions at known time points (e.g.
 event onsets for one condition) with each component of the RF.
 Each column takes the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X_{ij}\left(t\right)=u_{i}\left(t\right)*h_{j}\left(t\right),
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is the neural input with unit amplitude for condition 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is the index of the RF component.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 also contains a column for the intercept.
 It is possible to concatenate data from different experimental sessions,
 and an intercept is modelled for each session.
 The maximum-likelihood amplitude estimates are then computed using the
 Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{+}$

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-linear model inversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models in which timing and/or dispersion of the neural input need to be
 estimated require non-linear model inversion.
 PsPM contains several efficient non-linear model inversion methods:

SCR arise from opening of sweat glands and are elicited via the sympathetic

 Nerve fibres carrying impulses to the sweat glands are termed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sudomotor nerve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (SN) fibres and can be measured by intraneural recordings.
 SN fibres are slow C-fibres.
 From their end terminal, the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine diffuses through
 the skin to reach sweat glands, a process on the time scale of up to a
 second.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frequency and amplitude of SCR is mainly influenced by psychological
 arousal.
 Because not all forms of psychological arousal may influence SCR in the
 same way, we term the relevant psychological state

 Hence, the PsPM model is

The peripheral LTI model can be evaluated explicitly (by intraneural recordings

 They found that for stimulation rates below 0.6 s (1 stimulus every 1.7 s)
 around 95% of variance could be explained by an LTI model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Indirect evidence: We have shown that for short events (< 1 s duration)
 that are separated by at least 30 s, more than 60% of the variance in (high
 pass filtered) SCR can be explained under an LTI model, for aversive white
 noise bursts, aversive electric stimulation, aversive pictures, auditory
 oddballs, and a visual detection task 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Is this residual variance (40%) due to violations of the LTI assumptions?
 We have shown that in the absence of any event for 60 s, signal variance
 amounts to more than 60% of total variance during stimulus presentation.
 That is to say, by introducing events, residual baseline variance is reduced
 by 20%.
 This suggests that residual variance is not caused by violations of the
 time invariance assumption but variation of the neural input (for example,
 spontaneous fluctuations), and observation error.

 They found that for stimulation rates above 0.6 s (1 stimulus every 1.7 s),
 the response function looked very different from lower frequencies, suggesting
 non-linearities at that stimulation frequency.
 They did not quantitatively characterise these non-linearities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Indirect evidence: The linearity principle amounts to saying that SCR are
 not influenced by the (preceding) baseline signal.
 We tested this assumption by presenting two subsequent aversive white noise
 bursts with an inter stimulus interval (ISI) of either 2 s, 5.5 s, or 9
 s, such that the baseline signal at these three time points differed markedly.
 Violations of the linearity principle in the peripheral system would imply
 that the amplitude of the subsequent response is dependent on the baseline
 signal, and thereby, upon the ISI.
 The second response was always smaller than the first.
 However, this was not dependent on the ISI, and hence not on the baseline
 signal.
 We interpret this effect as central repetition suppression (of the neural
 inputs into the peripheral system) and conclude that linearity is appropriate
 for the peripheral system.
 In other words, the peripheral response to one input is not modulated or
 affected by the response to another, even when they overlap in time

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Skin Conductance Response Function (SCRF)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The peripheral model in its general form does not specify a particular form
 of the SCRF.
 There are three principled ways of defining a SCRF in PsPM:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Individual response function.
 The most precise option is to measure the SCRF for each individual by providing
 brief inputs into the peripheral system and measuring the response.
 PsPM allows specifying individual response functions.
 The benefit of this approach has not been empirically tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Canonical response function.
 The most parsimonious method is to use a so-called canonical SCRF which
 is assumed to be constant across individuals.
 We have previously shown that a canonical SCRF can explain on average 50%
 of the variance in individual SCR elicited by various stimuli, while individual
 SCRFs explain about on average 75% of the variance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bach:2010ad"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Using a canonical SCRF, linear and non-linear models show a good predictive
 validity, superior to peak-scoring methods

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Constrained response function.
 One can estimate an SCRF from the data of an actual experiment and use
 this for analysis.
 It is usually necessary to constrain the shape of the SCRF to make the
 model estimable.
 PsPM provides two options for this: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In GLM, one can estimate parameters of the (orthogonalised) time derivative
 of the SCRF.
 In order to combine this with the canonical SCRF, the response can afterwards
 be reconstructed for each experimental condition, and the peak amplitude
 taken as estimate of SA.
 This approach has higher predictive validity than using the canonical SCRF
 alone, or using a less constrained SCRF (canonical with time and dispersion
 derivative) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bach:2013aa"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the non-linear model for event-related SCR, one can use the combined
 data from all evoked responses from one individual to estimate an SCRF.
 This approach only considers data within the inter-trial interval.
 In a validation experiments study with ITI of 7-11 s, this had lower predictive
 validity than using the canonical SCRF, and we would not recommend it unless
 the ITI is longer than 20 s, so that the SCRF tail can be unambigouosly
 estimated

The first PCA component of the empirical SCRF was approximated was fitted
 by a Gaussian smoothed bi-exponential function (also named bi-exponentially

 categories, in particular Gaussian smoothed monoexponential function, exponenti

 The function is thus defined as
\end_layout

 to define the two decay components.
 This function is normalised to its maximum such that an infinitely short
 SN impulse with unit amplitude elicits an SCR with unit amplitude.
 This renders parameter estimates from linear models easily interpretable
 in relation to conventional (peak-scoring) analysis.

 we propose to use this empirical response function for SF.

 seconds (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 For situations in which central processes translate SA into SN with unknown

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

 Specifically, the experimental SCR component models evoked and event-related
 responses, and the SF component models spontaneous fluctuations between
 trials (part of the latent error).
 The SCL term is an explicitly modelled error term that absorbs baseline
 fluctuations and is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 By default, PsPM automatically mdoels SN bursts that occur more than 5
 s after the previous trial, and more than 2 s before the next trial.
 These limits ensure that the modelled SCL and SF do not absorb variance
 caused by the experiment.
 The use of different limits has not empirically been tested.

In this model, the parameter space is too large to invert it at once.
 Inversion is done in a trial-by-trial approach: a number of trials, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1..n}$
\end_inset

 is inverted.
 The ensuing parameter estimates for 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

 are extracted, and the parameter estimates for 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2..n}$
\end_inset

 are used as prior values for the next inversion for trials 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2..n+1}$
\end_inset

 where the estimated hidden state values at the start of trial 2 are taken
 as starting values of the hidden states 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 This is continued until all trials have been estimated.
 This scheme ensures that inversion is kept tractable, and at the same time
 overlapping responses are taken into account.
 It also means that estimation errors accumulate over trials which is why

Non-linear model for tonic SA (spontaneous fluctuations, SF)

\begin_layout Standard
Spontaneous SN bursts cause spontaneous fluctuations (SF) in skin conductance.
 The number of spontaneous SN bursts is thought to depend on SA.
 Each spontaneous SN burst is modelled as a Gaussian bump with unknown timing
 and amplitude and fixed dispersion.
 For each spontaneous SF burst:

Filtering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Skin conductance signals return to a baseline after an SCR, but this baseline
 can change over time within a large dynamic range.
 Such fluctuations of the skin conductance level need to be filtered out
 to make the data accessible to an LTI model.
 A unidirectional 1st order Butterworth high pass filter with cut off frequency
 0.05 Hz was optimal for GLM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bach:2013aa"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The design matrix of the GLM is filtered with the same frequency to account
 for distortions of response shape.
 For the non-linear model (DCM) for event-related responses, an optimal
 filter frequency was found at 0.0159 Hz when using a canonical SCRF and
 inversion of 2 trials at the same time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Filter characteristics of SF models have not been investigated.
 In order to reduce computation load, data are resampled to 10 Hz sampling
 rate for all data analyses which requires a low-pass filter cut off frequency
 of 5 Hz.

Historical remark:
\shape default
 The SCRF was developed using a high pass filter with cut off frequency
 of 0.0159 Hz as commonly employed in conventional analysis (bidirectional
 for phasic responses, unidirectional for spontaneous fluctuations).
 However, this turned out to not be the optimal filter for GLM in follow-up
 analyses of optimal data conditioning.
 Note that the canonical SCRF was developed from data filtered with the
 original settings, and this has not changed since.

Normalisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For within-subjects analysis, we propose data normalisation after filtering
 to remove SCR scaling differences due to peripheral factors such as skin
 property.
 This increases predictive validity (unpublished analyses).
 For methods that yield trial-by-trial estimates, post-hoc normalisation
 of amplitude estimates across trials, before averaging within conditions,
 yields even better predictive validity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 For between-subjects analysis, this is not an option as it removes between-subj

 That is, by simply taking the time integral, or area under the curve (AUC),

 This measure is implemented in the software as well.

 is a better predictor of tonic SA than AUC, and hence we recommend to use
 the non-linear model for tonic SA.

 - for one of them, the implementation is publicly available in the software
 package Ledalab.
 In this method, SN is calculated from SCR using a deterministic inverse
 filter.
 Peaks in the SN time series are then identified and used as operational
 index of SA.
 In a head-to-head comparison, predictive validity to identify states with
 known SA was compared for experiments involving short stimuli and evoked
 SA.
 PsPM had better predictive validity than Ledalab in 4 out of 5 tested contrasts
, and equal validity in the fifth.
 Ledalab did not consistently perform superior to classical peak scoring
 analysis

General

\begin_layout Standard
Cardiac rhythm is generated locally in the sinoatrial node, but is modulated
 by central neural input.
 Therefore, heart rhythm can be used to infer psychological states.
 To quantify phasic changes in cardiac chronotropy, two measures are common:
 heart rate (beats per minute) or heart period (milliseconds).
 Heart period appears to relate to autonomic input linearly, as revealed
 in experiments in which autonomic nerves in rodents were electrically stimulate
d with varying frequencies to elicit heart period changes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Berntson:1995"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This is why PsPM models heart period.
 Heart period information is only available at discrete time points.
 To facilitate analysis within the existing algorithms, PsPM assigns each
 heart period to its following heartbeat and linearly interpolates this
 time series at 10 Hz resolution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the analysis of event-related, i.e.
 phasic cardiac responses, PsPM includes two models: A model for event-related
 HPR 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and a model for fear-conditioned bradicardia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Castegnetti:2016aa"

\end_inset

.
 As in previous models for Skin Conductance Responses (SCR), both models
 are optimised with regard to 
\shape italic
predictive validity
\shape default
, i.e.
 the ability to separate experimental conditions (e.g., CS+ vs.
 CS-).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Operational analysis has shown that event-related HPR pattern strongly depends
 upon properties of the input - i.e.
 modality, intensity and presentation duration of the stimulus material.
 It follows that both models can only be applied in experiments with similar
 conditions, including stimulus presentation times (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\leq$
\end_inset

 1 s for event-related HPR).
 Pharmacological studies have suggested a differential time course of sympatheti
c and parasympathetic nervous input, but it is not yet known how this maps
 onto the response components modelled here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Peripheral and neural model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the absence of information on the timecourse of cardiac information,
 it is difficult to separate a neural and a peripheral model.
 Hence, these two are collapsed for the purpose of quick and simple inversion
 with GLM (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:General-linear-convolution"

\end_inset

).
 This means that the two implemented models - for evoked HRP and fear-conditione
d HRP - use a different RF, although of course the peripheral system is
 the same in both cases.

The model for event-related HPR

 was developed on data from 84 participants that underwent three different
 experiments: An experiment using loud white noise sounds (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim85dB$
\end_inset

), an experiment using an auditory oddball task, and an experiment using
 emotional pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS;
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bradley:2001"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 All stimuli were presented with long ITIs (> 30 s) to allow the cardiac
 system to return to baseline after stimulus presentation and avoid overlapping
 responses.
 The first three principal response components were extracted, and individual
 peaks fitted with Gaussian Functions as RF:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h\left(y\right)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-(t-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}\label{eq:Gaussian}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To test whether a modeled peak qualified as a RF, we tested whether it explained
 interesting variance in the data.
 We started with a single RF and included further RFs.
 Specifically, we created a first-level GLM for each participant by convolving
 the event onsets with the specific subset of RFs, and extracted estimates
 of the response amplitudes for each RF and condition from the continuous
 heart period data.
 In order to qualify as RF, parameter estimates for this RF were either
 required to depict a stable response (i.e., acceleration or deceleration)
 across all experiments, tested by a one-sample t-test, or to add to the
 
\shape italic
predictive validity
\shape default
 of the model.
 This second criterion was evaluated by subjecting the parameter estimates
 to a between-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing for a main effect
 of experimental condition.
\begin_inset Newline newline

 Hence, the following steps were taken:

\series bold
Step 1.

\series default
 Test all potential RFs modeled from PCs individually and retain each single
 RF if it depicts a stable acceleration or deceleration across all experiments
 or if it allows separation of at least two of the three experiments.
 All potential RFs fulfilled one of these criteria.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset space \hspace*{}
\length 10mm
\end_inset


\series bold
Step 2.

\series default
 Take the chronologically first RF from Step 1 and combine it with the chronolog
ically second RF from Step 1, or with any other RF that overlaps with this
 second RF.
 Orthogonalize each set in temporal order, using a Gram-Schmidt algorithm.
 Retain the best set if additional RFs allow the separation of the three
 experiments.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset space \hspace*{}
\length 10mm
\end_inset


\series bold
Step 3-5.

\series default
 Take the current set, and add the chronologically next untested RF from
 Step 1, or any other RF that overlaps in time with this second RF.
 Repeat the strategy of Step 2, and retain the best set if additional RFs
 allow the separation of the three experiments.

 This model-based analysis was developed on the basis of four independent
 data sets, acquired during diverse implementations of a fear conditioning
 protocol.
 The shape of the response was determined by visually identifying a gamma
 distribution as the function that qualitatively best resembled the difference
 between grand means.
 This function

 Shifts in the response are modelled by its first time derivative.
 The ensuing model-based analysis reliably distinguishes HPR to CS+ and
 CS-, and does so significantly better than model-free analogues (e.g., peak
 scoring, area under the curve).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adaptation to different SOAs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By considering fear conditioning sessions with different SOAs between CS
 and US, we investigated how this changes the anticipatory response.
 Our analysis suggested that for different SOAs the anticipatory HPR is
 time-locked to the US, with no changes in shape.
 This can be modelled by time-locking the RF (developed for 3.5 s) to the
 US.
 In PsPM, the default SOA is 3.5 s, and it can be modified to assume any
 positive value.
 However, we recommend not using SOAs shorter than 2 s.
 This procedure has been successfully tested with SOAs of 4

 The algorithm analyses slope, amplitude, and width of QRS complexes.
 It uses digital band-pass filters to reduce noise and its thresholds are

 The algorithm works best on data with a time-resolution of 200 Hz.
 Data with higher sampling rate will automatically be downsampled to the
 optimal time-resolution.
 The QRS complex is marked at the rising edge of the integrated waveform
 signal that usually corresponds well with the position of the R-spike of
 the ECG.

 On the basis of two experiments that elicited (il)luminance changes, we
 have developed a model for steady state pupil size and, more importantly,
 an model for changes of pupil size that is based on two LTI systems.
 These LTI systems can be harnessed to infer the neural input into the pupillary
 system that is elicited by cognitive processes (under the assumption of
 a common final pathway of (il)luminance-mediated inputs and cognitive inputs).
 We have also developed and validated a specific LTI system that allows
 distinguishing responses to CS+US- and CS- in fear-conditioning setups
 employing different sensory modalities and timings

Model for pupil dilation/constriction

\begin_layout Standard
Dilations and constrictions differ in shape, and can thus not be modeled
 by a single LTI system (which would assume that positive and negative changes
 do not differ in shape but just in sign).
 Hence, we identified a combination of two LTI systems that provide a good
 approximation of pupil size changes elicited by (il)luminance changes (see
 first two experiments in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Korn:2016a"

 The first LTI-system describes changes to continuous (il)luminace inputs
 and the second LTI-system models the difference between constriction and
 dilation.
 The second system thus receives a brief input for any increase in (il)luminance.
 Both systems are specified by canonical response functions that take the
 form of gamma probability density functions.

In GLM-based analyses, these systems explain considerable variance in pupil
 size time series in two experiments with (il)luminance inputs of long and
 short duration (with the second LTI system being particularly relevant
 for brief, i.e., sub-second, inputs).
 The modeled pupil size time series can be easily specified given a time
 series of (il)luminance values (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Prepare-illuminance-GLM"

\end_inset

).
 These time series can be used as nuisance regressors in GLMs.
 Because the end stage of the pupil system does not depend on where the
 neural input comes from, the specified canonical response functions can
 also be used to estimate the shape (i.e., the temporal characteristics) of
 likely inputs into the pupillary systems for cognitive tasks.
 We provide examples for this for auditory oddball tasks with three different
 timings, for an emotional words task, and for a visual detection task (see

 Eyelink import automatically converts input into diameter in absolute units

 For other sources it may be necessary to convert the data using the respective

 Geometrically, it would be possible to fit the visible pupil shape with

 However, apparently many eyetrackers simply report the number of pupil

 an area measure.
 For example, although the Eyelink 1000 eyetracker has the possibility to
 choose an ellipsoid model, this is according to the manual (User Manual.

 (1) To detect loss of fixation there is a specific function (see

 The user has to specify the distance between screen and eye, the screen
 size, the position of the fixation point (by default the middle of the
 screen is assumed but additionally a time series of fixation points can
 be specified), and the threshold for exclusion set in degrees of visual
 angle.

 correction as described in

 The implementation itself is eyetracker or measurement method independent;
 however, we use Eyelink in its name because the method was proposed specificall
y for Eyelink 1000 eyetracker.
 To perform PFE correction, PsPM requires extra information about the recording
 setup.
 Specifically, screen resolution, screen size and the screen-camera-eye
 geometry setup must be known.

 This method distinguishes RAR to CS+ and CS- better than model-free scoring
 of RAR (e.g., peak scoring).
 Compared to other measures of fear learning, RAR turn out to perform similar
 to SCR, but are less sensitive than HPR.
 By comparing CS/US SOAs of 3.5, 4, and 6 s, it is evident that the RAR are
 most likely time locked to the US.
 In the model, both components of the RF are shifted in time as a function
 of the SOA.
 To avoid deformation of the early RF due to violations of the linearity
 assumptions, however, we recommend to use this method only with experiments
 involving SOAs longer than 2.5 s.

Transducer output is filtered offline with an anti-aliasing bidirectional

 Data are then downsampled to 10 Hz resolution.
 Respiration traces are mean-centred, filtered with a bidirectional Butterworth
 band pass filter and cut-off frequencies of 0.01 Hz and 0.6 Hz, and median
 filtered over 1 s.
 A negative zero-crossing is taken as start of inspiration.
 After each detected cycle, PsPM imposes a 1 s refractory period, to account
 for residual signal noise with might cause several zero-crossings on the
 same cycle.
 In the validation data set, we compared this method to visual detection
 as gold standard and found, for the automated method, a sensitivity of
 99.3%, and a positive predictive value of 99.5%.
 For the time difference between visual and automated detection, we found
 a median delay of 0.1 s and a standard deviation of 0.1 s

For data obtained from the cushion/belt system, the above algorithm must

 Specifically, we defined the onsets of the inspirations as the minima of

 Hence, the algorithm was adapted to extract zero crossings of the derivative
 of the time series (i.e., the extrema), from which the positive ones (i.e.,
 the minima) were set as the start of the inspiration.

To transform the discontinuous RP, RA and RFR information into a continous

 PsPM also allows writing out the respiration time stamps for quality control.
 The interpolation shifts some early evoked responses such that they appear
 to start before an event - this is automatically being taken care of by
 a response function that starts slightly before an event definition.
 The best filter frequencies in

Peripheral and neural model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the absence of information on the millesecond-time course of neural response
 in the centres controlling startle, it is difficult to separate a neural
 and a peripheral model.
 Hence, these two are collapsed for the purpose of quick and simple inversion
 with GLM (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:General-linear-convolution"

\end_inset

).
 Because the startle response is so stereotypical, the same RF is used for
 all applications, and the amplitude estimated.
 There appears to be some variability in the latency of the startle response
 between trials and participants, such that the neural model contains a
 (constrained) latency parameter that is estimated from the data.
 The startle eye blink response function (SEBRF) is based on data from 19
 participants that heard startle sounds with no other manipulation.
 Pre-processing parameters were optimised to distinguish CS+/CS- in a fear
 retention task with 20 participants in which startle onsets were recorded
 for enhanced temporal precision.
 They were then validated on two independent samples of 15 and 14 participants
 in a fear retention, and fear acquisition task, respectively.
 The SEBRF is described as a gamma distribution

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, as shown in multiple stimulus competition paradigms using aversive cues.
 This yields a possibility to assess threat memory by overt attention.
 In cue competition paradigms, overt attention is usually measured as gaze
 patterns; for example, fixation duration, saccade initiation latency, and
 number of erroneous saccades.
 Here, we implement a model that captures gaze patterns during exclusive
 presentation of a single cue, by assessing scanpath speed, the length of
 scanpath per time unit, quantified as degree visual angle per second 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "xia:2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In our publication, we refer to scanpath length, which is the integral
 of scanpath speed over time.
 Since we used constant cue presentation times in our publication, average
 scanpath speed and scanpath length were identical up to a multiplicative
 constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model for fear-conditioned SPS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scanpath speed/length allow differentiating CS+ and CS- in fear-conditioning
 paradigms with visual cues, and without fixation instructions or fixation
 cross.
 PsPM implements two simple models that build on the GLM inversion algorithm
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:General-linear-convolution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 The first model is to compute average scanpath speed during a 2-s time
 window before US (shock) delivery.
 This was validated on three independent samples in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "xia:2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The model is implemented with a simple boxcar response function without
 mean-centering and is the default option.
 Parameter estimates can be interpreted as average scan path speed per second,
 and if they are multiplied with 2 then the resulting values can be interpreted
 as scan path length during the 2 s preceding the US.
 We also implement a gamma RF that describes the shape of the scanpath speed
 during the CS-US interval better than the boxcar function, but did not
 yield higher retrodictive validity in inferring the CS-/+ difference.
 This RF was fitted to the data of 21 participants and validated in an independe
nt sample; it is described by a gamma probability density function: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y=\frac{A}{\mu^{k}\Gamma(k)}(t-t_{0})^{k-1}e^{-\frac{t-t_{0}}{\mu}}

PsPM provides procedures to import scan path speed directly.
 More commonly, it is convenient to import gaze coordinates in pixels, distance

 This requires interpolation of missing values which is done automatically.
 Conversion from pixels to mm or visual angle in degree is also possible.
 No filtering or smoothing is required for both RF during model inversion

Windaq (PsPM Version)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Windaq import written by the PsPM team.
 Is platform independent, thus has no requirements for ActiveX Plugins,
 Windows or 32bit Matlab.
 Imports the *.wdq files.
 Up to now the import has been tested with files of the following type:
 Unpacked, no Hi-Res data, no Multiplexer files.
 A warning will be produced if the imported data-type fits one of the yet
 untested cases.
 If this is the case try to use the import provided by the manufacturer
 (see above).

Eyelink
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eyelink output files (with extension *.edf) must first be converted to ASCII
 format (extension *.asc).
 This is done with the utility edf2asc.exe (normally included in the Eyelink
 software in <Path to Program Files>
\backslash
SR Research
\backslash
EyeLink
\backslash
EDF_Access_API
\backslash
).
 Otherwise there is a Data viewer, available at 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 (registration needed), which installs a utility called 'Visual EDF2ASC'.
 This also allows the conversion and does not require a license.
 The composition of channels depends on the acquisition settings.
 Available channels are Pupil L, Pupil R, x L, y L, x R, y R, Blink L, Blink
 R, Saccade L, Saccade R.
 The channels will be imported according to a known data structure, therefore
 channel ids passed to the import function or set in the Batch will be ignored.
 If the import function defines PsPM file channels that are not available
 in the data file, these channels will be filled with NaN values.
 Periods of blinks and saccades will be set to NaN in the gaze and pupil
 channels.
 To reduce the impact of loss of fixation on recorded pupil size, we recommend
 setting ELCL_PROC to ELLIPSE during acquisition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Pupil Channels and Eyetracker distance 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance between eyetracker camera and recorded eyes in length units.
 If the given eyetracker distance is given as a positive numeric value,
 it enables the pupil data to be converted from arbitrary area or diameter
 units to diameter (mm) and then to the length unit of the eyetracker distance.
 If eyetracker distance is not given, or if it is not a positive numeric
 value, then the conversion to mm is disabled.
 In this case, pupil data will be imported in arbitrary (Eyelink) units.
 (Use only if you are interested in relative values)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relation between arbitrary units (a.u.) and diameter is assumed to be

ratio corresponds to the scaling factor in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 For area-based conversion, we use the scaling factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1.70\times10^{-4}$
\end_inset

as given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hayes:2015a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For a reference distance of 700 mm this translates to 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{area}=0.119$
\end_inset

 mm.
 For diameter-based conversion, we determined reference distance and the
 proportionality factor in a simpler calibration with three different artificial
 pupil sizes setting using linear regression.
 We note that for a different Eyelink eye-tracker setup, conversion with
 these values yielded results with slight deviance from the expected value,
 such that they are either not entirely precise, or there may be small differenc
es between different eyetrackers.

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
Blink/Saccade Edge Discard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Samples surrounding a blink or saccade period may be noisy.
 For this reason, Eyelink import provides a parameter that allows users
 to specify the amount of samples they want to discard on each side of every
 blink and saccade period.
 This value is multiplied by the sampling rate of the recording to determine
 the number of samples to discard from one end.
 Therefore, for each blink/saccade period, 
\begin_inset Formula $2\cdot factor\cdot F_{sampling}$
\end_inset

 many samples are discarded in total, and effectively blink/saccade period
 is extended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This value also corresponds to the duration of samples to discard on one
 end in seconds.
 For example, when it is 0.01, we discard 10 ms worth of data on each end
 of every blink/saccade period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default value has been changed to 0 in PsPM revision r803 to reduce
 the amount of discarded data.
 Note that this might result in noisy samples around blink/saccade points.
 Therefore, it is highly recommended to perform pupil size data preprocessing
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Paragraph*
SMI (SensoMotoric Instruments)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SMI output files (with extension *.idf) must first be converted to ASCII
 format (extension *.txt) using IDF converter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SMI iView X EyeTracker sample and optionally also event files can be imported.
 The SMI sample file contains pupil, gaze and position related information.
 The SMI event file contains information about blink/saccade events.
 Available channels to import are Pupil L, Pupil R, Gaze x L, Gaze x R,
 Gaze y L, Gaze y R, Blink L, Blink R, Saccade L, Saccade R, Marker, Custom.
 All channels except custom are imported according to a known data structure.
 Therefore, there is no need to specify the column indices of channels.
 If specified channels are not available, they will be filled with NaN values.
 If an event file is given so that blinks/saccades are available, blink
 and saccade periods will be set to NaN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple ways to specify pupil information in SMI sample files.
 Instead of importing all the channels for a given eye, PsPM selects only
 one of the available ones according to the following precedence order:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mapped Diameter (mm)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dia X (mm)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dia (squared mm)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dia X (px)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dia (squared px)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the chosen pupil channel is in squared px or squared mm, then it is converted
 to diameter by assuming the shape is a circle.
 However, no conversion from pixels to milimeters is performed for pupil
 channels.
 Therefore, if a pixel or squared pixel channel is chosen, it is returned
 in pixel units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returned gaze coordinates assume that (0, 0) point of the calibration area
 is the top left corner.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 coordinates increase towards right and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 coordinates increase downwards.
 If the resolution of the whole stimulus window is given, the gaze values
 are returned in the desired target unit.
 Otherwise, they are returned in pixels.
 It is important to note that the values can be negative or larger than
 the sides of the screen, if gaze is outside the calibration area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gaze values are reported in pixels by SMI.
 The conversion from pixels to milimeters is performed by using the size
 and the resolution of the stimulus window to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $px/mm$
\end_inset

 ratio, and then using this ratio for scaling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Viewpoint (Arrington Research)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arrington Research ViewPoint EyeTracker files can be imported into PsPM.
 Available channels to import are Pupil L, Pupil R, Gaze x L, Gaze x R,
 Gaze y L, Gaze y R, Blink L, Blink R, Saccade L, Saccade R, Marker, Custom.
 Currently, blink and saccade events can only be imported if they are stored
 as asynchronous messages in the datafile.
 This is enabled by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Include Events in Datafile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option in ViewPoint EyeTracker software.
 All channels except custom are imported according to a known data structure;
 therefore, there is no need to specify the column indices of channels.
 If specified channels are not available, they will be filled with NaN values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ViewPoint reports data for eye A in monocular mode and for eyes A and B
 in binocular mode.
 PsPM performs the following mapping from A/B to L/R:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If only one eye is specified by user (only L or only R) and there is only
 eye A in data, then data for eye A is returned as the eye specified by
 user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In all other cases, eye A is mapped to eye R and eye B is mapped to eye
 L.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All gaze and diameter values are reported as ratios by ViewPoint:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Gaze value for a given axis is the ratio of the gaze coordinate to the length
 of that axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Pupil diameter is the ratio of pupil width to the EyeCamera window width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since ViewPoint data files contain the size of the stimulus window in milimeters
, PsPM converts normalized gaze values to values in milimeter.
 This is performed by multiplying the ratio with the length of the corresponding
 stimulus window axis.
 Returned gaze coordinates assume that (0, 0) point of the stimulus window
 is the top left corner.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 coordinates increase towards right and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 coordinates increase downwards.
 The gaze values are returned in the desired target unit.
 It is important to note that the values can be negative or larger than
 side of the screen which correspond to looking outside the stimulus window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pupil diameter is returned as ratio without any conversion.

Channel Type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specify the type of data in this channel.
 Currently supported data types: SCR, ECG, heart beat markers, interpolated
 heart rate, interpolated heart period, respiration traces, interpolated
 respiration period, pupil size, EMG, marker channels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Channel /Column Number
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specify where in the original file to find the data - depending on your
 data type this will be a channel or column number.
 You can either specify a number (i.
 e.
 the n-th channel in the file), or (for many data types) search for this
 channel by its name.
 Note: the channel number refers to the n-th recorded channel, not to its
 number during acquisition: if you did not save all recorded channels, these
 might be different for some data types.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Search [if available]: Search for channel by its name – this only works
 if the channel names are unambiguous, and not for all data types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Specify Channel Number [if required according to data type, otherwise a
 default channel number will be assigned]: Specify the n-th channel.
 This counts the number of channels actually recorded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ECG editor is integrated into the QRS detection and can also be used
 offline, after QRS detection.
 It allows to graphically inspect and correct (if necessary) the detected
 QRS markers.
 To faciliate QRS inspection in data sets with known artefact epochs, the
 user can load epoch files which define such artefact periods.
 This allows the editor to either ignore or even remove QRS markers which
 fall into artefact periods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Startup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ECG editor can be started from the PsPM window, from the Matlabbatch
 window or from the command line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the command line the ECG editor can be started by typing 
\family typewriter
pspm_ecg_editor(argument)
\family default
 into the Matlab command line.
 For this the PsPM folder has to be added to the matlab path beforehand.
 Arguments are either a data struct (generated usually by 
\family typewriter
pspm_ecg2hb
\family default
) or a path to a PsPM file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Data modes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the data editor the ECG editor supports two types of operation
 modes, which depend on the startup arguments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
File mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is entered when the editor is started from the PsPM window, from the Matlabbatch
 or when a file path or no argument is specified at the command line startup.
 If the first argument is a file path, a second (ECG channel) and a third
 argument (Options struct) is possible.
 The second argument specifies the ECG channel to be plotted.
 The third argument is expected to be a struct with the following fields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
hb - specifies a HB channel which contains the QRS markers to be inspected
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
factor - specifies the minimum factor faulty QRS markers should deviate
 from the standard deviation (default is 2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
semi - specifies whether to navigate between potentially wrong hb events
 only (semi mode), or between all hb events (manual mode; semi mode is enabled
 by default).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
limits - with fields 'lower' and 'upper' defines hard limits for the faulty
 detection (default is 120bpm [upper] and 40bpm [lower])
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second and third argument is optional.
 In file mode the 'Input / Output' panel on the bottom of the left side
 is visible.
 It allows to specifiy and change input files and channels (ECG and HB)
 and allows to choose whether the edited data should be added as a new HB
 channel or replace the existing HB channel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Inline mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inline mode is usually used together with 
\family typewriter
pspm_ecg2hb
\family default
.
 Therefore a struct which is generated by the latter function is expected.
 The following fields are needed for the editor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
settings
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
.outfact - specifies to which factor faulty QRS markers should deviate from
 the standard deviation

.sr - specifies the sample rate of the data
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
data
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
.x - contains the ecg data values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
.r - contains n x 4 vector where n corresponds to the ecg data values and
 columns 1-4 tell whether there is a QRS marker (column 1-4) and whether
 a QRS marker is faulty (column 2).
 Columns 3 and 4 are ignored and regenerated during data inspection
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
.R - contains sample ids of all the QRS markers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Editor output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output always contains as a first argument a status (sts).
 If the status equals 1 no error happend while creating the output.
 Otherwise the editor could not successfully create the output.
 The second output depends on the data mode and in file mode contains the
 channel id of the written channel.
 In inline mode the second output argument is a data vector which contains
 the sample ids of the resulting QRS markers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Data inspection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Navigation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ECG editor uses QRS markers as anchor points for the navigation.
 One option to navigate between QRS markers is to use the listbox placed
 in 'Heart beat events' on the right side of the plot.
 Selecting a QRS marker in the listbox will cause the plot to center the
 selected marker with some space left before and after depending on the
 zoom state.
 If manual mode is active, the listbox contains all QRS markers available
 (all colors), otherwise it will only contain QRS markers marked as faulty
 (orange).
 The navigation buttons ('<<' and '>>') below the listbox allow moving back
 and forth in the plot.
 In manual mode the step size equals the size of the plot window.
 If manual mode is inactive, the next/previous step equals jumping to the
 next/previous faulty QRS marker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Zooming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The zoom buttons are placed on the upper right.
 Zooming in will cause the time window to be shortened by the factor of
 two.
 Zooming out will cause the time window to be extended by the factor of
 two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Add QRS marker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The button for this is placed on the upper right side.
 Once clicked the cursor will turn into a crosshair.
 After that, clicking on the plot will cause an additional QRS marker to
 be added at that position (a green QRS marker appears).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Remove QRS marker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The button is also placed on the upper right side.
 The cursor aswell will turn into a crosshair but different to adding QRS
 markers, clicking on the plot (without releasing the mouse-button) will
 cause a selection rectangle to be drawn.
 Upon release of the mouse-button all QRS markers which lie in the selection
 rectangle will be marked for removal (violet).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Artefact epochs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Settings for the artefact epochs can be found in the 'Artefact epochs' panel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Load / Disable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clicking the 'Load' button causes a file dialog to appear, which allows
 to choose a PsPM epoch/timing file containing the definition of artefact
 epochs.
 The button 'Disable' will cause the artefact epochs to be unloaded and
 artefact settings to be disabled.
 Once an artefact epoch file is loaded, QRS marker stems and listbox font
 color will turn grey if they lie within an artefact epoch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Display settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three different display options on how to deal with QRS markers
 which fall into artefact epochs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use all QRS markers - do nothing; all markers will be displayed and used
 for faulty detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
exclude artefact periods from faulty QRS detection - still all markers will
 be displayed but QRS markes in artefact periods will be ignored for faulty
 detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
hide QRS markers during artefact periods - QRS markers in artefact periods
 will be hidden and ignored for faulty detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Output settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two different output options on how to deal with QRS markes which
 fall into artefact epochs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
include QRS during artefact periods - all markers (faulty and valid) including
 those lying in artefact periods will be either returned or written to the
 new HB channel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
remove QRS during artefact periods - only markes (faulty and valid) outside
 of artefact periods will be either returned or written to the new HB channel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Faulty detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Settings for faulty detection can be changed in the 'Heart beat events'
 panel.
 The following settings are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Detection factor - specifies the minimum factor faulty QRS markers should
 deviate from the standard deviation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Upper limit - Heart rates higher than the upper limit will be marked as
 faulty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lower limit - Heart rates lower than the lower limit will be marked as faulty

\begin_layout Standard
Convert continuous respiration traces into interpolated respiration period,
 amplitude, or RFR, or into time stamps indicating the start of inspiration.
 This function detects the beginning of inspiration (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Breathing-cycle-detection"

), assigns period/amplitude/RFR of the last cycle to this data point, and
 interpolates data (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Interpolation-and-Filtering-Resp"

\end_inset

).
 This function outputs respiration period rather than respiration rate in
 analogy to heart period models - heart period linearly varies with ANS
 input to the heart.
 RFR (respiratory flow rate) is the integral of the absolute thorax excursion
 per respiration cycle, divided by the cycle period.
 Converted data are written into new channel(s).

\begin_layout Standard
Transform an illuminance time series into a convolved pupil response time
 series to be used as nuisance file in a GLM.
 This allows you to partial out illuminance contributions to pupil responses
 evoked by cognitive inputs.
 Alternatively you can analyse the illuminance responses themselves, by
 extracting parameter estimates relating to the regressors from the GLM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The illuminance file should be a .mat file with a vector variable called
 Lx.
 In order to fulfill the requirements of a later nuisance file there must
 be as many values as there are data values in the data file.
 The data must be given in lux (lm/m²) to account for the non-linear mapping
 from illuminance to steady-state pupil size.
 A function to transform luminace (cd/m²) to illuminace values is provided
 under PsPM > Data processing > Pupil & Eyetracking.

\begin_layout Standard
Pupil data time series can contain missing values due to blinks and head
 movements.
 Additionally, pupil measurements obtained from a video-based eye tracker
 depend on the gaze angle, therefore breaks of fixation can be excluded.
 Valid fixations can be determined by setting an a priori threshold with
 respect to the fixation point (in degree visual angle) for x- or y-gaze-positio
ns.
 The input are x- and y-gaze positions converted to length units (see

 The output is a time series with NaN values during invalid fixations (discrimin

 Both the duration of gaps and the invalid sample duration before/after
 the gaps are configurable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Trendline filtering: A data trend is generated by smoothing and interpolating
 the data.
 Then, samples that are too far away from this trend are considered invalid.
 These two steps are performed multiple times in an iterative fashion.

Pixel to unit
\shape default
: Convert pupil gaze coordinates from pixel values to unit values.
 The unit values can be distance units or degree visual angle.
 In the latter case, the data are first converted into distance units and
 then to visual angle.
 Visual angle is expressed in spherical coordinates as two-element vector
 where the first element refers to the azimuth angle and the second to the
 elevation angle.
 The azimuth angle is the counterclockwise angle in the x-y plane measured
 in degree from the positive x-axis (This axis is parallel to the screen
 pointing toward your right).
 The elevation angle is the angle in degree from the x-y plane in z-axis
 direction.
 The range for the azimuth indicates the angle of the left left edge of
 the screen to the angle of the right edge of the screen.
 The range for the elevation indicates the angle of the bottom edge of the
 screen to the angle of the top edge of the screen.

\begin_layout Standard
Non-linear models for SCR are powerful if response timing is not precisely
 known and has to be estimated.
 A typical example are anticipatory SCR in fear conditioning – they must
 occur at some point within a time-window of several seconds duration, but
 that time point may vary over trials.
 Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) is the framework for parameter estimation.
 PsPM implements an iterative trial-by-trial algorithm.
 Different from GLM, response parameters are estimated per trial, not per
 condition, and the algorithm must not be informed about the condition.
 Trial-by-trial response parameters can later be summarized across trials,
 and compared between conditions, using the contrast manager.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specify the timings of individual events from your design either by creating
 a timing file or by entering the timings manually.
 The DCM framework allows you to specify two types of events:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fixed latency (evoked): An event is assumed to elicit an immediate response.
 The amplitude of the sympathetic arousal will be estimated, while the latency
 and duration of the response are fixed.
 This event type is meant to model evoked responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flexible latency and duration (event-related): An event is assumed to elicit
 sympathetic arousal within a known response window, but with unknown amplitude,
 latency and duration.
 For each event of this type, specify a time window in which the response
 is expected.
 PsPM will then estimate the amplitude, duration and latency of the response.
 An example for this type of event is an anticipatory response which might
 vary in timing between trials (e.
 g.
 in fear conditioning).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Timing File: The timing file has to be a .mat file containing a cell array
 called 'events'.
 For a design with n trials and m events per trial (n × m events in total),
 the cell array has to be structured in the following way: Create m cells
 in the cell array (one per event type that occurs in each trial).
 Each cell defines either a fixed or a flexible event type.
 A cell that defines a fixed event type has to contain a vector with n entries,
 i.e.
 one time point per trial, in seconds, samples or markers.
 A cell that defines a flexible type has to contain an array with n rows
 and two columns.
 The first column specifies the onsets of the time windows for each trial,
 while the second column specifies the offsets of the time windows.
 It is assumed that all trials have the same structure, i.e.
 the same number of fixed and flexible event types.
 For individual trials with a different structure you can enter negative
 values as time information to omit estimation of a response.
 For later comparison between trials of different conditions, it is absolutely
 mandatory that they contain the same types of events, to avoid bias.
 Hence, if one condition omits an event (e.
 g.
 unreinforced trials in conditioning experiments), the omitted event needs
 to be modelled as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enter Timing Manually: In the DCM framework, a session is structured in
 n individual trials.
 Each trial contains m fixed and/or flexible event types.
 All trials need to have the same structure.
 Create event types to define the structure of a trial and enter the timings
 for all events.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Name (optional): Enter a name of the event.
 This name can later be used for display and export.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Onsets: For events with a fixed response, specify a vector of onsets.
 The length of the vector corresponds to the number of trials (n).
 For events with a flexible response, specify a two column array.
 The first column defines the onset of the time window in which the response
 occurs.
 The second column defines the offset.
 The number of rows of the array corresponds to the number of trials (n).
 All timings are specified in seconds.

Conditions (optional)

\begin_layout Standard

 NaN periods within the evaluated subsessions will be interpolated for averages

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 either as epoch files or manually.
 Start and end points have to be defined in seconds starting from the beginning

\end_layout

Missing Epoch File: Indicate an epoch file specifying the start and end
 points of missing epochs (m).
 The mat file has to contain a variable ‘epochs’, which is an m x 2 array,
 where m is the number of missing epochs.
 The first column marks the start points of the epochs that are excluded
 from the analysis and the second column the end points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enter Missing Epochs Manually: Enter the start and end points of missing
 epochs (m) manually.

Note: pspm_dcm calculates the inter-trial intervals as the duration between
 the end of a trial and the start of the next one.
 ITI value for the last trial in a session is calculated as the duration

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
In case of case (2), after each trial, all the samples in the period with
 duration equal to the just mentioned overall min ITI value is used as a
 row of the input matrix.
 Since this minimum does not use the min ITI value of the last trial in
 each session, the sample period may be longer than the ITI value of the
 last trial.
 In such a case, pspm_dcm is not able to compute the PCA and emits a warning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The rationale behind this behaviour is that we observed that ITI value of
 the last trial in a session might be much smaller than the usual ITI values.
 For example, this can happen when a long missing data section starts very
 soon after the beginning of a trial.
 If this very small ITI value is used to define the sample periods after
 each trial, nearly all the trials use much less than available amount of
 samples in both case (1) and (2).
 Instead, we aim to use as much data as possible in (1), and perform (2)
 only if this edge case is not present.

\begin_layout Standard
This suite of models is designed for analysing spontaneous fluctuations
 (SF) in skin conductance as a marker for tonic arousal.
 SF are analysed over time windows that typically last 60 s and should at
 least be 15 s long.
 PsPM implements 3 different models: (1) Skin conductance level (SCL): this
 is the mean signal over the epoch (2) Area under the curve (AUC): this
 is the time-integral of the above-minimum signal, divided by epoch duration.
 This is designed to be independent from SCL and ideally represents the
 number x amplitude of SF in this time window.
 (3) Number of SF estimated by DCM (Dynamic Causal Modelling) or MP (Matching
 Pursuit): this is a non-linear estimation of the number of SF, and is the
 most sensitive indicator of tonic arousal.
 It relies on absolute data values as it implements and absolute threshold
 for data peaks.

Method 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choose the method for estimating tonic sympathetic arousal: AUC (equivalent
 to number x amplitude of spontaneous fluctuations), SCL (tonic skin conductance
 level), DCM or MP.
 The latter two estimate the number of spontaneous fluctuations, requiring
 absolute data units as both methods implement an absolute amplitude threshold.
 In theory, DCM provides highest sensitivity but is slow

 MP is a very fast approximation to the DCM results, and comparable in sensitivi

\begin_layout Standard
Define within-subject contrasts here for testing on the second level.
 Contrasts can be between conditions (GLM), epochs (SF) or trials (Non-linear
 SCR models).
 Contrast weights should add up to 0 (for testing differences between conditions
/epochs/trials) or to 1 (for testing global/intercept effects across conditions/
epochs/trials).
 Example: an experiment realises a 2 (Factor 1: a, A) x 2 (Factor 2: b,
 B) factorial design and consists of 4 conditions: aa, aB, Ab, AB.
 Testing the following contrasts is equivalent to a full ANOVA model: Main
 effect factor 1: [1 1 -1 -1], Main effect factor 2: [1 -1 1 -1], Interaction
 factor 1 x factor 2: [1 -1 -1 1].
 To test condition effects in non-linear models, assign the same contrast
 weight to all trials from the same condition.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contrasts are usually specified on parameter estimates.
 For GLM, you can also choose to specify them on conditions or reconstructed
 responses per condition.
 In this case, your contrast vector needs to take into account only the
 first basis function.
 For non-linear SCR models, you can specify contrasts based on conditions
 as well.
 This will average within conditions.
 Use the review manager to extract condition names and their order.
 This argument will be ignored for other first-level models.

This is a vector on all included conditions (GLM), trials (non-linear SCR

 Shorter vectors will be appended with zeros.
 To specify a condition or trial difference, the contrast weights must add
 up to zero (e.
 g.
 was sympathetic arousal in condition A larger than in condition B: c =
 [1 -1]).
 To specify a summary of conditions or trials, the contrast weights should
 add up to 1 to retain proper scaling (e.

 was non-zero sympathetic arousal elicited in combined conditions A and
 B: c = [0.5 0.5]) .

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Data edtior can be started from the PsPM window, the Matlabbatch and
 from the Matlab command line.
 The command line startup requires the PsPM folder to be added to the Matlab
 path.
 Once that is done, the data editor can be started by typing '
\family typewriter
pspm_data_editor(argument)
\family default
' in the Matlab command line.
 The command accepts two types of arguments.
 (i) a path to file, which causes the editor to open the specified file
 and to work in the '
\series bold
file mode
\series default
' or (ii) a data vector which causes the editor to plot the passed data
 vector and to work in the '
\series bold
inline mode
\series default
'.
 If no argument is specified, the editor is stared in 'file mode'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Data modes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data editor differs between two data modes.
 The data mode depends on the specified startup argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
File mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is entered when called from the PsPM window, the Matlabbatch or a file path
 or no argument is speciefied at command line startup.
 File input/output settings aswell as the Channel view are visible on the
 left.
 The latter can be used to select the plotted channel.
 Multiple selection is possible and the color of the plot corresponds to
 the color in the channel list.
 File input settings can be used to change the file to be edited, while
 the output settings specify where the edited data should be stored to.
 It is also possible to specify the output file from when calling the data
 editor using Matlabbatch or the argument options.output_file from the Matlab
 command line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Inline mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is entered when a data vector is specified as command line startup argument.
 Channel view and file input/output settings are hidden.
 Once the user exits, the editor returns either the interpolated data or
 the selected epochs in a PsPM epoch format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Data navigation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data navigation can be done by zooming (
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Figures/icons/button_zoom.PNG

\end_inset

) and panning (
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Figures/icons/button_pan.PNG

\end_inset

).
 Zooming does only change the horizontal axis.
 After zooming axis limits remain fixed when changing the selected channel.
 This sometimes may cause data not to be plotted because the data points
 are out of the visible range.
 Zooming out will make the data appear again.
 Panning allows the rearrangement of the plot horizontally and vertically.
 After panning the axis limits remain fixed as well and data may disappear
 when changing the selected channel.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Epochs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Add epochs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
New epochs can be added by clicking the 'add epoch' button (
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Figures/icons/button_add_epoch.PNG

\end_inset

).
 Once clicked the cursor will change to a crosshair and it is possible to
 select data in the plot, which will upon release create a new epoch in
 the selected range.
 The new epoch will appear on the right side in the epoch list and is marked
 in green on the plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Remove epochs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Existing epochs can be removed by clicking the 'remove epoch' button (
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Figures/icons/button_remove_epoch.PNG

\end_inset

).
 Once clicked the cursor will change to a crosshair and it is possible to
 select the range in which the epochs should be removed.
 If an epoch is selected partially, the rest of the epoch will remain.
 The epoch-list on the right side will be updated automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Epoch navigation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to navigate between epochs it is either possible to use the epoch
 list on the right side or the two epoch navigation buttons (
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename Figures/icons/button_navigate_epochs.PNG

\end_inset

).
 The selected epoch always corresponds to the selected epoch in the epoch-list
 and is marked in black in the plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Output format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two possible output formats.
 The output, depending on the data mode, will either be written to a specified
 output file (file mode) or will be returned as a data vector (first argument;
 inline mode).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Epochs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If epochs is selected, the output will be a n x 2 vector, where n is the
 number of epochs.
 The first column marks the onset of the epoch, while the second column
 marks the offset of the epoch.
 The time unit is seconds.
 In file mode the data will be written into the specified mat file in the
 variable 'epochs'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Interpolated data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If interpolated data is selected, the output will be the specified data
 itself with the selected channels (in Channel view) interpolated during
 the selected epochs.
 In file mode the original channels will be replaced.
 If 'Display interpolated curve' is checked the interpolated data will be
 displayed in the plot as a dashed line.

\begin_layout Standard
Split sessions, defined by trains of markers.
 This function is most commonly used to split fMRI sessions when a (slice
 or volume) pulse from the MRI scanner has been recorded.
 In automatic mode, the function will identify trains of markers and detect
 breaks in these marker sequences.
 In manual model, you can provide a vector of markers that are used to split
 the file.
 The individual sessions will be written to new files with a suffix ''_sn'',
 and the session number.
 You can choose one datafile and, optionally, one missing epochs file, which
 will be split at the same points.
 By default, the function will use the first marker channel.
 Alternatively, you can choose a marker channel number.

 Therefore first file se and second file set must have the same number of
 elements.
 Within each pair of files, they are aligned according to the first event
 of a given marker channel, or to the start of the file.
 The output file consists of an ‘m’ at the beginning and the name of the
 first file appended.

 Each participant saw 45 neutral and 45 aversive pictures within one session
 that included two short breaks.
 SCR data were recorded using a 0.5 V coupler, optical (wave to pulse) transducer
, and CED Spike, with a minimum sampling rate of 100 Hz.
 Be aware that this example uses functions from the MATLAB Signal Processing
 Toolbox, make sure to have it installed before starting the tutorial.

Non-linear SCR tutorial: Delay fear conditioning data
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The example data set comprises SCR data from 20 participants, with 40 trials
 each, which can be downloaded from 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "https://bachlab.github.io/PsPM/software/"
target "https://bachlab.github.io/PsPM/software/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 together with the result files of the model inversion.
 Participants underwent a differential delay fear conditioning paradigm
 where coloured circles were presented for 4 seconds each.
 Either the blue or orange coloured circles (balanced over participants)
 were probabilistically paired with an electric stimulation (unconditioned
 stimulus, US) that coterminated with the stimulus (conditioned stimulus,
 CS+) while the CS- were always presented alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presenting the CS+ causes phasic sympathetic arousal in anticipation of
 an electric shock.
 This anticipatory reaction typically occurs with an unknown and variable
 latency after stimulus onset.
 For such cases, a GLM should not be used because it assumes that sympathetic
 arousal follows the stimulus with a fixed latency.
 In contrast, the non-linear model allows estimating (i) a variable onset
 within a user-specified time window and (ii) a variable duration of a sympathet
ic response.
 Additionally, the non-linear model includes estimation of spontaneous fluctuati
ons that occur between trials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this tutorial, the non-linear model is estimated.
 The estimated parameters can then be used to test the within-subject hypothesis
 that the sympathetic arousal between CS+ and CS- are different on a group
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Setup the Non-Linear Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this step you prepare the model estimation.
 For this, you need to provide timing information about the experimental
 events which can either be entered manually or as a Matlab file.
 For large numbers of events as in this experiment, a timing file can easily
 be created using a few lines of Matlab code.
 Here we use timing information saved in the trimmed PsPM file.
 In this file, a trigger was saved at every CS onset.
 For timing information from other sources, the code has to be adapted according
ly.
 Go to the Matlab command window and enter the following lines, but replace

The resulting file

 contains the variable events with two cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first cell 
\emph on
events{1}
\emph default
 is a 40 x 2 matrix with the onset and offset of a time window for each
 trial in which we expect the response to the CS (both CS+ and CS- are treated
 the same here).
 We expect the response to the CS to occur with a variable onset in time.
 Note that the window for the CS response ends when the US starts (or is
 omitted), i.e.
 after 3.5 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The second cell 
\emph on
events{2}
\emph default
 is a 40 x 1 vector that marks the onset of the electrical stimulation.
 For this event we expect an evoked response with constant latency after
 US occurrence.
 Importantly, we provide timings 
\emph on
both for the occurrence and the omission of the US
\emph default
.
 Modelling an unconditioned response in all trials is necessary to get unbiased
 estimates for the CS responses.
 In general, the trial structure should always be the same for all trials,
 across experimental conditions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most experiments, you want to analyze data from multiple subjects, which
 implies that you have to repeat model estimation several times.
 There are two simple strategies to make this easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use dependencies: You can specify all steps for one subject in one go.
 At some points, you need to specify a file from a previous step (e.g., when
 trimming you need the file containing the imported data).
 In these cases, you can use the button “Dependency” to specify the correspondin
g file, but make sure the number of output files of the preceding module
 corresponds with the allowed number of input files for this module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Loop over participants in the script: You can easily adapt the scripts for
 many subjects by including a loop and adapting the file names.
 This is independent of whether or not you use dependencies.
 To show you how this works, see the examples below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Importing and trimming data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we create an example script for importing and trimming data.
 We chose these steps since they are required in all types of analysis.

Calling PsPM functions directly from the Matlab command line
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the above mentioned steps in this tutorial can also be done in the Matlab
 command line without using the Matlabbatch syntax.
 Calling PsPM functions allows fast analysis of the data, efficient processing
 of multiple subject data and gives a lot more flexibility when it comes
 to fine tuning.
 However, this also requires knowledge about the Matlab command line and
 about the PsPM functions used.
 In this section we will revisit some examples from above and go through
 them by calling PsPM functions directly.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Filtering for SCR models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous versions of PsPM have used a bi-directional high pass filter of
 0.0159 for all SCR analyses.
 We have recently shown a better predictive validity for GLM with a unidirection
al filter of 0.05 Hz 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bach:2013aa"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This also implies that different filters are used for different models.
 These are now set as defaults, and the way the default settings are implemented
 has changed.
 It is now possible to alter the filter settings in the model definition,
 although we discourage this.

General linear modelling (GLM)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Parametric modulators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parametric modulators (pmods) are z-normalised before being entered into
 the design matrix.
 This is to account for possibly very large or very small numbers – a badly
 scaled design matrix can cause induced instability in the inversion.
 The parameter estimates of the pmods were not transformed back in previous
 versions, i.
 e.
 the parameter estimates of the pmods were independent of the scaling of
 the pmods.
 This is appropriate as long as they are the same for all datasets, or if
 analysis is done strictly on a within-subject level.
 Some researchers have reported designs in which inference was to be drawn
 on parameter estimates of pmods on a between-group level, and where the
 pmods systematically differed between these groups.
 To account for this possibility, the parameter estimates are now transformed
 back, such that they refer to the pmods in their original scaling/units.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Parametric confounds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous versions of PsPM contained an option to include a parametric modulator
 across all event types, to account for confounds across all conditions.
 For example, in an experiment with 5 conditions, one could have included
 5 regressors, plus one reaction time confound across all events, without
 including an associated regressor that contains the event onsets for all
 these events.
 This option was removed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Design matrix filtering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous versions of PsPM filtered the design matrix after orthogonalisation
 of basis sets.
 This can introduce unwanted dependencies between regressors.
 PsPM 3.0 filters the regressors first, then orthogonalises the basis sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
File format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some minor changes have been made to the data format.
 In particular, marker channels from previous versions can not be read with
 the current version - such data files have to be re-imported.
 Model files have changed drastically, and model files from previous versions
 can not be read with the current version of the software.

Model comparison between old and new versions of the VBA toolbox, based
 on two delay fear conditioning datasets.
 The log Bayes factor quantifies the difference between negative log likelihood

Subsessions in DCM models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until now, long periods of NaN values (which are just disregarded) could
 cause problems for inversion of DCMs.
 These periods are now split (according to threshold value) into subsessions.
 The subsessions will be evaluated independently, while at the end the results
 will be stacked together.
 Therefore the output-format will not change and should be compatible with
 earlier releases.

Pupil Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Blink channels were removed.
 Periods during blinks and saccades are set to NaN already in the import
 function.
 This applies to all channels of the respective eye.
 Accordingly, blink validation functionality was removed in the function
 pspm_find_valid_fixations.
 If needed, blinks and saccades can be imported as custom channels using
 channel ids 7-10 (two eyes) or 4-5 (one eye), while blinks and left eye
 come first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Importing pupil channels now allows direct specification of a transfer function
 to convert arbitrary units to mm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Importing of eyes which have not been recorded creates channels containing
 NaN values, so that the same import batches can be used for groups of subjects,
 even if one eye is missing in some of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
