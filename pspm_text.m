After importing, a time window from t minus (#volumes )*(repetition time) seconds until t should be used for trimming or splitting of sessions to constrain data in the imported file to the EPI recording window and easier matching with experimental events from a separate source. Available trigger channels are (Channel id 1-10): Trigger ECG, Trigger PPG, Trigger Respiration, Measurement (?slice onset?), Start of scan sequence, End of scan sequence, Trigger external, Calibration, Manual start, Reference ECG Trigger.';

Otherwise there is a Data viewer, available at http://www.sr-research.com/dv.html (registration needed), which installs a utility called ''Visual EDF2ASC''. This also allows the conversion and does not require a license. The composition of channels depends on the acquisition settings. Available channels are Pupil L, Pupil R, x L, y L, x R, y R, Blink L, Blink R, Saccade L, Saccade R. The channels will be imported according to a known data structure, therefore channel ids passed to the import function or set in the Batch will be ignored. In the PsPM file channels, which were not available in the data file, will be padded with NaN values. Additionally periods of blinks and saccades will be set to NaN during the import.';
