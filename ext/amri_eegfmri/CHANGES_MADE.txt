amri_eeg_rpeak.m
----------------

* Changed the interface of amri_eeg_rpeak function to only take the ECG
signal as input and simply return rpeak indices as output.

* Changed lines containing

    [~,imax]=max(weights.*ccorr(anarrowrange));

to

    [~,imax]=max(weights' .* ccorr(anarrowrange));

so that it computes an expectation (as required?) and not an outer product
due to mismatched row and column vectors.
