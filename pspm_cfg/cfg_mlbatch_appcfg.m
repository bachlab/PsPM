% 'SCR' - MATLABBATCH cfg_util initialisation
% This MATLABBATCH initialisation file can be used to load application
%              'SCR'
% into cfg_util. This can be done manually by running this file from
% MATLAB command line or automatically when cfg_util is initialised.
% The directory containing this file and the configuration file
%              'pspm_cfg_appcfg'
% must be in MATLAB's path variable.
