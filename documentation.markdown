 **PsPM** provides a principled approach to
solving the inverse problem in psychophysiology: making inferences about
psychological processes, given physiological data. This is a common
application of psychophysiology - for example, making statements about
fear learning, by "scoring" skin conductance responses. In such cases,
the interest is not on the physiology itself - the interest is in the
psychological process. PsPM offers a theoretically grounded approach to
this problem. When you use PsPM code or concepts, we kindly ask you to
reference our papers. This helps us to justify our continued efforts
towards funders. Some PsPM pre-processing algorithms are based on other
people's work. This is detailed in the help of the respective
functions, and we kindly ask you to reference these researchers' work
when you use them.

and stimulation. *Psychophysiology*, *55*, e12986.
[\[PubMed\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28862764)

#### GLM for evoked skin conductance responses (eSCR)
This model assumes that
sympathetic nerve (SN) responses follow a short stimulus with constant
latency. The amplitude of these responses is estimated in the framework
of a general linear convolution model, using a canonical skin
conductance response function (SCRF), under linear time-invariance
assumptions, and an informed, linear neural model.

* The approach was
introduced in: Bach DR, Flandin G, Friston KJ, Dolan RJ (2009).

#### Non-linear model for event-related SCR
This model is used(e. g. for
anticipatory responses in fear conditioning, and assumes that the onset
of the neural response is not precisely known, and estimate onset,
dispersion, and amplitude of the response. They use the same SCRF as
models for eSCR, but the neural model now becomes non-linear. Model
inversion is therefore accomplished in the mathematical framework of
Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), using a variational Bayes inversion
scheme.

* This was described in: Bach DR, Daunizeau J, Friston KJ, Dolan
RJ (2010). Dynamic causal modelling of anticipatory skin conductance
responses. *Biological Psychology*, *85*, 163-70.

recommendations for an improved algorithm are published here: Staib M,

#### Models for spontaneous skin conductance fluctuations (SF)
These models are
entirely uninformed about the onset of neural responses. SF are often
thought to index tonic arousal. A very simple model estimates the mean
number of responses times mean amplitude per time unit, as area under
the curve (AUC) of the signal. The number of responses is however more
informative than their amplitude, such that a more sophisticated model
was developed to estimate neural response onsets and amplitudes
separately. This is similar to the approach for event-related SCR: it
uses a slightly modified SCRF, an uninformed non-linear neural model and
the DCM model inversion framework.

* The AUC model, a test for LTI
assumptions, and a modified SCRF for SF were introduced in: Bach DR,
Friston KJ, Dolan RJ (2010). Analytic measures for quantification of
arousal from spontaneous skin conductance fluctuations. *International
Journal of Psychophysiology*, *76*, 52-55.

spontaneous fluctuations is described in: Bach DR, Daunizeau J, Kuelzow

fluctuations in skin conductance. *Psychophysiology*, *48*, 252-257.

inversion approximation building on Matching Pursuit is introduced in:

tonic sympathetic arousal from spontaneous skin conductance
fluctuations. *Psychophysiology*, in press.

## Models for pupil data
Models are available for illuminance-elicited changes, cognitive input,
and specifically for fear conditioning. All model build on LTI systems
and are inverted in the framework of GLM. PsPM contains many
pre-processing and convenience functions for eye-tracking data.

* The
illuminance model and its application to cognitive paradigms was
introduced in: Korn CW & Bach DR (2016). A solid frame for the window on
cognition: Modeling event-related pupil responses. *Journal of Vision*,
*16*, 28. [\[PubMed\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26894512)

model for fear-conditioned pupil size responses (fcPSR) was introduced
in: Korn CK, Staib M, Tzovara A, Castegnetti G, Bach DR (2017). A pupil
size response model to assess fear learning. *Psychophysiology*, *54*,
330-343. [\[PubMed\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27925650)

## Models for heart data
These models specify patterns of heart-period responses evoked by short
events, or by fear-conditioned stimuli. These models formally build on
LTI systems and are inverted in the framework of GLM. Both were tested
in several independent data sets. Pre-processing functions allow
conversion of ECG, pulsoxymetry data, or pulse time stamps, into the
required format.

* The pre-processing pipeline and the model for evoked
heart period responses (eHPR) was introduced in: Paulus PC, Castegnetti
G, & Bach DR (2016). Modeling event-related heart period responses.

fear-conditioned heart period responses (fcHPR) was introduced in:

Modelling fear-conditioned bradycardia in humans. *Psychophysiology,
53*, 930-939. [\[PubMed\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26950648)

## Models for respiration data
These models specify patterns of respiration period, respiration
amplitude, or respiratory flow rate, evoked by short events. A further
model specifies patterns of respiration amplitude changes evoked by
fear-conditioned stimuli. These models formally build on LTI systems and
are inverted in the framework of GLM. All models were tested in
independent data sets. Pre-processing functions allow conversion of
pressure or bellows chest belt data into the required format.

pre-processing pipeline and the model for evoked respiratory responses
was introduced in: Bach DR, Gerster S, Tzovara A, Castegnetti G (2016).

Neuroscience Methods, 270,* 174-155.

fear-conditioned respiration amplitude responses (fcRAR) was introduced

## Model for startle-eye blink EMG
This model provides a unified scoring method for startle eye blink
responses (SEBR) as measured by EMG of the M. orbicularis oculi. It is
specified in the framework of LTI systems and inverted using a combined
template matching and GLM approach. Pre-processing is optimised for
measuring fear-potentiated startle, but the method is generally
applicable for any startle response.
