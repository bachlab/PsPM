function epochs = pspm_logical2epochs(index, sr)
    % ● Description
    %   logical2pspm_epochs converts a logical index vector into an nx2 
    %   onset/offset epoch matrix.
    % ● Format
    %   epochs = logical2pspm_epochs(index, sr)
    % ● Arguments
    %   *        index : [logical] index vector of length datalength
    %   *           sr : sample rate used when index was created
    %                    
    % ● Output
    %   *       epochs : nx2 (onset/offset) epoch matrix

    % Compute the differences between consecutive elements in the index array,
    % with padding at the start and end
    diff_index = diff([0; index(:); 0]);
    
    % Onsets are where the difference is 1 (0 to 1 transition)
    onsets = find(diff_index == 1);
    
    % Offsets are where the difference is -1 (1 to 0 transition)
    offsets = find(diff_index == -1);
    
    % Combine onsets and offsets into an nx2 matrix
    epochs = double([onsets, offsets]);

    % If the sample rate (sr) is not 1, convert indices back to time
    if nargin > 1 && sr ~= 1
        epochs = (epochs - 1) / sr;
