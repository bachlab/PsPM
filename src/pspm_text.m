function pspm_text(path)
% ● Description
%   pspm_text is a system UI control function. It saves the text for GUI display. When
%   PsPM starts up, pspm_text will generate a .mat file that saves these text. When PsPM
%   GUI needs to use such text, this .mat file will be called and displayed on the GUI.
%   When PsPM quits, this .mat file will be deleted from the folder.
% ● History
%   Introduced in PsPM 6.0
%   Written in 2022 and updated in 2024 by Teddy
