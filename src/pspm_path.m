function path_to_folder = pspm_path(varargin)
% pspm_path is an operating system agnostic function that returns the path
% of folders under root PsPM directory. This function is mainly used during
% directory imports to call functions from libraries or folders that are not
% added to path by default (such as backroom folder for utility functions).
%
% FORMAT:
%     path_to_folder = pspm_path(varargin)
%
% INPUT:
%     varargin: Pass any number of string arguments to pspm_path. Each argument
%               is assumed to be the name of a folder. For example, if you want
%               to get the path to <PSPM_ROOT>/a/b/c folder, call
%
%                   pspm_path('a', 'b', 'c')
%
% OUTPUT:
%     path_to_folder: Constructed absolute path
