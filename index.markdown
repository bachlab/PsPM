Psychophysiological data (e.g. SCR, pupil size, heart rhythm) are routinely used to quantify psychological states or latent variables (e.g. arousal, attention, decision uncertainty, or fear and reward memory). PsPM uses statistical models of the mind-body relationship in order to make this inference transparent. With an integrated and automated work flow from raw data import to export of participant-level (condition-level or trial-by-trial) summary statistics, PsPM combines analytical reproducibility with plug-and-play implementation.

PsPM implements convolution models to describe the relationship between psychological variables and the observed signal, and to estimate the psychological input into that generated the observed signal. These models have been developed on large and independent data set.

PsPM implements models for skin conductance, pupil size, gaze patterns, heart beats, respiratory signals, and startle eyeblink EMG. PsPM supports import of a number of data formats, including CED Spike, Biopac AcqKnowledge, VarioPort, (exported) ADInstruments LabChart, (exported) Biograph Infiniti, (exported) MindMedia BioTrace, Dataq/Windaq, ScanPhysLog, EDF, (asc-exported) Eyelink, Matlab, and Text files.

Further features are simple programming of add-ons for import and modelling of new data types, and automatic creation of batch scripts via the GUI.

Our [online course](https://bachlab.github.io/PsPM/learn/) provides in-depth information about the software and about the implemented methods, whether you are a newcomer to psychophysiological modelling or an experienced user who wants more detail.
