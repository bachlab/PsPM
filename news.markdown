PsPM 7.0.0 released, a complete revamp of the GUI and function logic with a focus on user experience, robustness and maintainability. Backwards compatibility is partial: PsPM data files from previous versions can be read, PsPM first-level model files are can be processed with the exception of extracting segments, Matlabbatch and function calls created with previous PsPM versions require adaptation.

Fear conditioning can be index by [various psychophysiological data types](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.04.019), but how these indices relate to each other? In this new paper, (Mancinelli, Sporrer, et al.)[https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-024-02341-3] find in N = 256 persons that fear conditioning strength estimated from SCR, heart period, respiration, and pupil size, covaries on only one dimension, suggesting that these indices are measuring the same latent variable. Combining two or more of these indices improves [retrodictive validity](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-00976-8%20) in out-of-sample generalisation tests and can thus help reducing sample size at the same statistical power.
