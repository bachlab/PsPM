Upgrading the mex code

1)  Run the ADISimpleDataFileSDK64.msi located at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\ADInstruments\LabChart8\Extras

2) Copy:
- ADIDatIOWin64.dll
- ADIDatIOWin64.lib

Over from: (path will be different by user)
C:\Users\Jim\Documents\ADInstruments\SimpleDataFileSDK

3) Check and see if the header file has changed and move it over if it has.
This however will most likely require some code changes ...

4) Run adi.sdk.makeMex
