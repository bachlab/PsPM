# GazeVisToolbox

MATLAB functions and GUIs for the visualization of eye tracking data, especially those acquired with EyeLink and SMI trackers. 

Depends on some helper scripts from https://github.com/djangraw/EegAndEye .

Import scripts assume the experiment was acquired using the data logging conventions in https://github.com/djangraw/PsychoPyParadigms .
